The values on the dice are 1 to 1O (the 1O face is repre- sented by a lantern). The number of dice you need to roll is specified by the number before \"d1 O\", so 2d10 is 2 dice. If the game instructs you to roll a d5, roll a d 1O and divide the result in half (rounded up). Rolling on tables is an important component of the game, introducing an element of chance to events.

For instance, players may find themselves fac- ing monsters with toughness so high that the maxi- mum die result (10) combined with their strength Is not enough to penetrate the monster's toughness. In this case, when a lantern 10 Is rolled, it will still wound (and cause critical wounds, if luck allows). Conversely, monsters may face situations where an attack roll will always hit. For example, at- tacking a survivor with negative evasion mght mean it would hit on a 1 or higher.

In such cases, Lantern 1O's al- ways succeed and 1's always fail. This way, the pos- sibility of success or failure exists, even in the most one-sided circumstances. For instance, players may find themselves fac- ing monsters with toughness so high that the maxi- mum die result (10) combined with their strength Is not enough to penetrate the monster's toughness. In this case, when a lantern 10 Is rolled, it will still wound (and cause critical wounds, if luck allows). Conversely, monsters may face situations where an attack roll will always hit. For example, at- tacking a survivor with negative evasion mght mean it would hit on a 1 or higher. In these cases a natural Conflicts and the Rule of Death As in any game with many moving parts and rules, confltct may occasionally anse regarding rules inter- pretations, group decisions, or exceptions. First and foremost, this game is designed to provide time well spent with friends. Use this as the guiding principle for solving any problems that arise. In addition, here are some technical guidelines for When conflict arises over contradictions in rules, apply specific rules found on cards (Al , gear etc) and story events, before any rules lound in the rulebook If confhcts arise that slow or halt a play ses- sions completely, use the Rule of Death: always rule against the survivors. Kingdom Death is a dangerous place, and the survivors' future is bleak. Make sure that any ambiguities resolve against the survivors' At its core, Monster is a cooperative experience. Be respectful of others as you navigate the game's Kmgdorn oeath: Monste r Core Game 39 Each surv,vor has a record sheet that keeps track of essenhal Informatron players will need to hunt, fight, and interact with the settlement. Make sure to use a Players use miniatures to represent their survivors on the hunt and showdown boards. Monster includes 4 starting survivor miniatures that represent the survi- vors In their most primitive state. Survivors change as they progress over lantern years, gaining gear and losing limbs. Players are en- couraged to build new miniatures of their survivors by combining pieces from different armor sets to create a miniature that represents their survivor's favorite gear Survivor miniatures don 't need to accurately re- flect the gear a player uses in the game . However, 11 your group decides to play this way, it is usually pos- sible to do so. Survivor miniatures use 30 mm bases. Naming your survivor gives them substance and a conneclton to the player Survival Is the desperate desire to cling to hie. Survival are gained and lost throughout the cam- paign, and may be spent to perform extraordinary feats and change your fate. When you name your survivor, they gain + 1 survival.

For example, the Screaming Antelope 's Giant Tongue is easier to wound because 1t has -2 toughness. Sometimes monsters react to being hit. Reactions on hit location cards are represented by a black diamond with an R. A reaction occurs after rolling to wound the hit location it is found on . The three types of reactions are wound , failure, and reflex. Critical wounds are represented by a black diamond with a lantern symbol , followed by rules that specify what happens when a monster is critically wounded at that location. A hit location can only be critically wounded 11 it has this symbol. Critical wounds are not reactions. W hen a critical wound occurs, all reactions on that hit location car d are canceled.
