Throughout the game, you will roll dice to determine the outcomes of everything from attacks to choosing When the game instructs you to roll d10s, it re- fers to the 10-sided dice included with the game. The values on the dice are 1 to 1O (the 1O face is repre- sented by a lantern). The number of dice you need to roll is specified by the number before \"d1 O\", so 2d10 is 2 dice. If the game instructs you to roll a d5, roll a d 1O and divide the result in half (rounded up). Rolling on tables is an important component of the game, introducing an element of chance to events.

Natural 1 refers to a roll result where the number \"1'' face showing During the showdown, it is possible to encounter situations where It Is impossible to succeed or fail at hitting or wounding.

For instance, players may find themselves fac- ing monsters with toughness so high that the maxi- mum die result (10) combined with their strength Is not enough to penetrate the monster's toughness. In this case, when a lantern 10 Is rolled, it will still wound (and cause critical wounds, if luck allows). Conversely, monsters may face situations where an attack roll will always hit. For example, at- tacking a survivor with negative evasion mght mean it would hit on a 1 or higher.

In such cases, Lantern 1O's al- ways succeed and 1's always fail. This way, the pos- sibility of success or failure exists, even in the most one-sided circumstances. For instance, players may find themselves fac- ing monsters with toughness so high that the maxi- mum die result (10) combined with their strength Is not enough to penetrate the monster's toughness. In this case, when a lantern 10 Is rolled, it will still wound (and cause critical wounds, if luck allows). Conversely, monsters may face situations where an attack roll will always hit. For example, at- tacking a survivor with negative evasion mght mean it would hit on a 1 or higher. In these cases a natural Conflicts and the Rule of Death As in any game with many moving parts and rules, confltct may occasionally anse regarding rules inter- pretations, group decisions, or exceptions. First and foremost, this game is designed to provide time well spent with friends. Use this as the guiding principle for solving any problems that arise. In addition, here are some technical guidelines for When conflict arises over contradictions in rules, apply specific rules found on cards (Al , gear etc) and story events, before any rules lound in the rulebook If confhcts arise that slow or halt a play ses- sions completely, use the Rule of Death: always rule against the survivors. Kingdom Death is a dangerous place, and the survivors' future is bleak. Make sure that any ambiguities resolve against the survivors' At its core, Monster is a cooperative experience.

Make sure to use a Players use miniatures to represent their survivors on the hunt and showdown boards. Monster includes 4 starting survivor miniatures that represent the survi- vors In their most primitive state. Survivors change as they progress over lantern years, gaining gear and losing limbs. Players are en- couraged to build new miniatures of their survivors by combining pieces from different armor sets to create a miniature that represents their survivor's favorite gear Survivor miniatures don 't need to accurately re- flect the gear a player uses in the game . However, 11 your group decides to play this way, it is usually pos- sible to do so. Survivor miniatures use 30 mm bases. Naming your survivor gives them substance and a conneclton to the player Survival Is the desperate desire to cling to hie. Survival are gained and lost throughout the cam- paign, and may be spent to perform extraordinary feats and change your fate. When you name your survivor, they gain + 1 survival.
