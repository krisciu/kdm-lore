# Kingdom Death Comic: Phobia (The Hunt)

The first printed issue under the Kingdom Death Comic imprint. Brought to our community by a one of our own, a fan of Kingdom Death: Monster and astonishing visionary, Pawel Zdanowski (with the help of a hand-picked team of artists and creatives).
Phobia (The Hunt) is a story of survivors ripped from the game table and brought to life in breathtaking, full-color illustrations and compelling storytelling. Team Death is honored to publish this story. Hopefully, one of many to come.
Kingdom Death Comic: Phobia (The Hunt) is a full-color 36 page comic presented in traditional American comic dimensions.
4 different covers are available including the original design by team Pawel (white cover), and three variant covers illustrated by Team Death. Lokman Lam (pink cover), Wenjuinn Png (gray cover), Ein Lee (red cover). Interiors are identical.
