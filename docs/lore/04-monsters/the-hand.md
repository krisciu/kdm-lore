# The Hand

> *"Master Manipulator"*

**Category:** Monster
**Type:** Nemesis
**Expansion:** Core Game

---

## Overview

The Hand is a nemesis monster that stalks settlements in the Kingdom Death: Monster core game campaign. Bearing the ominous epithet "Master Manipulator," this entity represents the third major nemesis threat that survivors must overcome in their desperate struggle for existence. As a node 3 nemesis, The Hand arrives after settlements have weathered the brutality of both the Butcher and the King's Man, testing whether the fledgling civilization has truly learned to survive or merely delayed its inevitable extinction.

The Hand occupies a critical position in a settlement's timeline—appearing when survivors have begun to establish themselves but before they face the ultimate terrors that lurk in the darkness. Its title suggests an intelligence beyond mere predatory instinct, hinting at a creature that does not simply hunt but *orchestrates*, pulling at the threads of fate that bind the settlement together.

## Physical Description

*[Limited information available from sources. The Hand's physical appearance is not detailed in the provided materials, though its product imagery suggests a distinctive and imposing figure befitting its role as a major nemesis threat.]*

## Role in the Campaign

The Hand serves as the third nemesis encounter in the core game's campaign structure. This "node 3" position places it as a pivotal challenge—settlements that have survived to face The Hand have already proven their mettle against lesser nemeses, yet the true horrors of the world still await. The "Master Manipulator" must be overcome for any hope of reaching the campaign's later stages and confronting what lies beyond.

Settlements seeking alternative paths through the darkness may find themselves facing the Black Knight instead, a different node 3 nemesis that replaces The Hand when that expansion is incorporated into the campaign.

## Lore Significance

The title "Master Manipulator" carries weight in the nightmare realm of Kingdom Death. In a world where survival often depends on understanding the unknowable behaviors of monstrous entities, a creature defined by manipulation represents a uniquely terrifying threat. Where other nemeses may embody raw violence or relentless pursuit, The Hand suggests something more insidious—a horror that works through influence, control, and the corruption of that which survivors hold dear.

*[Speculation: The name "The Hand" may imply this entity serves as an extension or instrument of greater powers, reaching into settlements to shape events according to some unfathomable design.]*
