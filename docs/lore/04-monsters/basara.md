# Basara

Starving, Basara approached the pit. A rich, toothsome aroma lingered but nothing remained. Disappointed she plucked the red weed pushing up between the crystals at her feet. She nibbled experimentally as she hurried to catch up to the others. Numbing and invigorating spice burned her mouth, glittering smoke sizzled from her lips. When she stepped into the lanterns light, the others were blinded by kaleidoscopic refractions of rainbow-hued sweat pouring down her face. From that moment, her instrument had a new sound.
Basara comes with 2 miniatures. A painters scale model kneeling, perfect for hobbyists and a players scale model for gamers looking for a fun survivor stand-in.
