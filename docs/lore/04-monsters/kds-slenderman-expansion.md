Digital Slenderman Expansion
The Slenderman is a dark, cold hole in the memories of the few that have seen it and lived. Within this chilling gap of recollection, terror thrives, growing into panic and jumbled tales of warning. Facing the Slenderman tests the teamwork and sanity of the survivors that face it. The monster's movements are unpredictable, and it will often vanish from the board, leaving the team to carefully coordinate their actions to bring down their foe.
Slenderman's rewards are as alien as the monster itself. Strange substances from the Slenderman's domain will need careful research before they're put to use.
This expansion is designed to be added to the simulator digital Kingdom Death: Monster core game. It includes:
Digital Slenderman monster miniature
26 x Digital Gear cards
34 x Digital Slenderman AI cards
18 x Digital Slenderman HL
6 x Digital Strange Resource cards
2 x Digital Disorder cards
