# Dung Beetle Knight Expansion 1.6

Resourceful and hungry, this cunning species has evolved a knight's shape to fool booth predators and prey. It rolls a massive resin ball formed from spit used to collect rare feces for its meals.
The Dung Beetle Knight is an extremely difficult foe. You will find that a little preparation goes a long way. The Rumbling in the Dark innovation will offer your settlement the opportunity to train before they face the Dung Beetle Knight. This is an opportunity that should not be missed.
The Dung Beetle Knight is a node 4 quarry monster, a magnificent challenge for the most ambitious settlements late in their campaign.  This expansion replaces nothing, no such level of challenge exists in the core Kingdom Death: Monster campaigns. It includes:
Dung Beetle Knight sprues (includes survivor gear, Resin Dung Ball, and the Dung Beetle Knight Monster)
34x Gear Cards
41x Dung Beetle Knight AI cards
24x Dung Beetle Knight HL cards
11x Dung Beetle Knight Resource cards
5x Strange Resource cards
7x Dung Beetle Knight Hunt Event cards
1x Terrain card
2x Disorder cards
2x Fighting Art cards
1x Secret Fighting Art card
1x Armor Set Bonus
3x Tactics cards
2x Innovation cards
1x Dung Beetle Knight Settlement Location
2x Dung Beetle Knight card dividers
