# Lonely Tree Expansion 1.6

If you can see the Lonely Tree for what it really is, it's probably too late. This carnivorous organism hypnotizes anything that comes near, luring prey with hallucinations of their innermost desires. Once they draw near, the hallucinations turn to ceaseless dreams, while the roots consume the victim in their sleep.
With each meal, a grotesque bulge, appears on the Lonely Tree's branches which slowly swells and takes on certain qualities of the devoured as they are digested. This "fruit" of the Lonely Tree is its true prize, as eating these conglomerations of phytohormones and human gristle can have beneficial (albeit bizarre) side effects. However, make sure to handle them gently while they are close to the tree, as the chemical volatility of the unripened morsels doubles as the Lonely Tree's primary form of self-defense!
This expansion is designed to be added to the Kingdom Death: Monster core game. It includes:
Lonely Tree Sprues
25x Lonely Tree AI cards
23x Lonely Tree HL cards
1x Lonely Tree Hunt Event card
5x Strange Resource cards
1x Terrain card
1x Lonely Tree card divider
