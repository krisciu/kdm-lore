# Smog Singers

> *"Docile creatures that mean no harm but cause massive carnage with their strange music."*

**Category:** Monster
**Type:** Quarry (Node 2)
**Expansion:** Gambler's Chest Expansion

## Overview

The Smog Singers represent one of the most tragic paradoxes of the darkness—creatures utterly without malice whose very existence brings devastation to those who encounter them. Encountered in territories where the Screaming Antelope might otherwise roam, these entities produce a strange, otherworldly music that wreaks havoc upon all who hear it. Unlike the deliberate cruelty of many monsters that stalk the darkness, the Smog Singers appear genuinely docile, making them all the more dangerous for survivors who might mistake their passivity for safety.

What makes a Smog Singer "sing" remains poorly understood, but the carnage left in their wake speaks to the terrible power of their sound. Settlements that choose to hunt these creatures as their primary Node 2 quarry must adapt to an entirely different kind of threat—one born not of tooth and claw, but of resonance and vibration that tears at flesh and sanity alike.

## Physical Characteristics

The Smog Singers appear to be associated with environments where crystalline formations and strange flora intersect. Accounts from survivors describe areas marked by peculiar red weeds that push up between crystals—vegetation that carries potent alchemical properties. Those who consume these weeds experience intense burning sensations followed by the bizarre phenomenon of glittering smoke sizzling from their lips and kaleidoscopic, rainbow-hued perspiration.

*[Speculation: The creatures may produce or be attracted to the same chemical compounds found in these red weeds, which could explain both their name and the hallucinogenic quality of their "music."]*

## Hunting the Smog Singers

Survivors who successfully hunt Smog Singers gain access to unique resources that can be crafted into specialized armor—the Smog Singer Armor set represents the ingenuity of settlements that have learned to turn the creature's strange properties to their advantage. The resources harvested from these beings also inspire musical instruments of unusual power.

Particularly ancient specimens that have gone unchallenged in the darkness develop unusual features, becoming what survivors term "Indomitable." These elder Smog Singers yield indomitable resources capable of inspiring extraordinary gear configurations, such as the Thumping Timpani—a percussion weapon that turns the creature's own sonic principles against the monsters of the darkness.

## Lore Significance

The Smog Singers challenge the fundamental assumption that survival in the darkness requires identifying and destroying hostile entities. These creatures demonstrate that danger in this world extends beyond intent—that the very nature of some beings is incompatible with human existence, regardless of disposition. Settlements must weigh the moral complexity of hunting creatures that harbor no ill will, balanced against the practical necessity of harvesting their remains to ensure survival.

The musical connection suggests deeper mysteries about sound and resonance in the Kingdom Death universe, hinting at fundamental forces that can be harnessed by those brave or desperate enough to face their source.
