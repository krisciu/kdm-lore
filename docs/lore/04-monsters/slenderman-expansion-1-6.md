# Slenderman Expansion 1.6

The Slenderman is a dark, cold hole in the memories of the few that have seen it and lived. Within this chilling gap of recollection, terror thrives, growing into panic and jumbled tales of warning. Facing the Slenderman tests the teamwork and sanity of the survivors that face it. The monster's movements are unpredictable, and it will often vanish from the board, leaving the team to carefully coordinate their actions to bring down their foe.
Slenderman's rewards are as alien as the monster itself. Strange substances from the Slenderman's domain will need careful research before they're put to use.
Slenderman is a node 2 nemesis monster, it tests the mettle of settlements further along in their campaign. This expansion replaces the King's Man in Kingdom Death: Monster campaigns. It includes:
Slenderman sprues (includes survivor gear and the Slenderman Monster)
26x Gear cards
34x Slenderman AI cards
18x Slenderman HL
6x Strange Resource cards
2x Disorder cards
2x Fighting Art cards
1x Secret Fighting Art card
1x Innovation card
2x Settlement Event cards
2x Slenderman card dividers
