# Spidicules Expansion 1.6

Vibrating to make itself invisible to the human eye, the Spidicules leaves its forest dwelling and lurks in settlements unnoticed. It kidnaps survivors for its own delight as well as to nourish its ever-growing brood.
Unless survivors can hack off a few legs, the Spidicules' hit-and-run tactics will prolong the showdown and distract them from the army of Spiderlings steadily amassing to feed. Harvest valuable silk and end the showdown quickly, before you are overwhelmed and devoured!
Spidicules is a node 2 quarry monster, it provides expanding settlements with new tools and avenues of growth.  This expansion replaces the Screaming Antelope in Kingdom Death: Monster campaigns. It includes:
Spidicules sprues (includes survivor gear, Spiderlings, and the Spidicules Monster.)

30x Spidicules AI cards
