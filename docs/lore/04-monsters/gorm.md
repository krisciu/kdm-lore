# Gorm

> *"Young Gorm roam the darkness devouring anything that moves—and many things that don't."*

## Overview

The Gorm is a primordial creature whose existence is measured not in mere years, but in the vast distances it travels across the endless darkness. These beasts are forces of geological consequence—their enormous appetites and extreme bodily functions literally reshape the landscapes they traverse. Where a Gorm has passed, nothing remains unchanged.

As a node 1 quarry, the Gorm represents one of the earliest challenges a fledgling settlement may face. It serves as an alternative to the White Lion, providing young survivors with their first sustenance and resources. Yet hunters who pursue this quarry must approach with caution, for the Gorm is notoriously volatile. Its alien anatomy, while dangerous, holds secrets that can unlock powerful tools for those settlements clever enough to harvest and study its remains.

The Gorm occupies a unique ecological niche in the darkness—a wandering engine of consumption and transformation whose passage marks the land for generations.

## Physical Description & Biology

The Gorm's biology is defined by extremity. Its appetite is boundless, driving it to consume anything organic—or otherwise—that crosses its path. This constant feeding fuels not only the creature's bulk but also its "extreme bodily functions," processes so powerful they alter terrain and environment in their wake.

*[Speculative based on context: The creature's form suggests a bloated, perhaps amphibious or gastropod-like anatomy, built for both consumption and the long migrations that define its existence.]*

What makes the Gorm particularly valuable to survivors is the complexity of its internal anatomy. Unlike simpler quarry, the Gorm's organs, tissues, and secretions can be rendered into sophisticated tools and equipment—rewards that justify the considerable risks of hunting such an unpredictable beast.

## Life Cycle

The Gorm's life cycle spans hundreds of lantern years and encompasses three distinct phases:

**Youth:** Young Gorm are ravenous wanderers, roaming the darkness in a constant state of consumption. They devour anything that moves, and their hunger extends even to motionless matter. During this phase, they are perpetually on the move, feeding and growing.

**Maturity:** As Gorm age and enter their mating season, they become engines of atmospheric destruction. Older Gorm produce storms of incredible intensity—whether through biological processes, bizarre mating displays, or some other mechanism remains unclear. These storms are legendary for their devastation, suggesting that mature Gorm are best avoided entirely.

**Ancient Age:** Gorm that survive to extreme old age—measured in hundreds of lantern years—undergo a final transformation. They cease their wandering consumption and begin a solitary pilgrimage to the legendary **gormyards**, mythical places where ancient Gorm go to die. This final march is a solemn journey, the last act of creatures that have spent lifetimes reshaping the world through appetite alone.

## Lore Significance

The Gorm represents one of Kingdom Death's core themes: the relationship between consumption and creation, destruction and sustenance. These creatures are living catastrophes, yet their deaths provide the raw materials for human survival. Settlements that hunt Gorm participate in an ancient cycle—taking from creatures whose entire existence has been defined by taking.

The existence of the gormyards suggests a deeper order to the darkness, places of significance that even monstrous beings recognize. Whether these graveyards are literal locations, metaphysical destinations, or something stranger entirely remains unknown. Their existence implies that even creatures as alien as the Gorm possess some instinct beyond mere hunger—a drive toward a final destination, a recognition of mortality.

For survivors, the Gorm offers a brutal bargain: face a volatile, unpredictable beast in exchange for resources that can elevate a settlement beyond mere subsistence.
