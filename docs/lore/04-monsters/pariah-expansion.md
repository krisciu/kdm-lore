# PARIAH

The Pariah is an unconventional nemesis monster for Kingdom Death: Monster. Stunning and dramatic components accompany this unique monster.
Consumed by bitterness, the Pariah longs for the embrace of every settlement it visits. Those that accept it will suffer the monster's cruel caprices until they drive it out.
Pariah in your Monster Campaign
Pariah [NN1] is a node 1 nemesis monster, it arrives to challenge burgeoning settlements. This expansion replaces the Butcher in Kingdom Death: Monster campaigns.
A settlement infested by the Pariah's influence will grow to mirror its twisted image.
Pariah Two Ways
Your exploited settlement will resist the monster's fiendish games, with its hooks in your settlement's empathic impulses, the monster protects itself against your aggression by sharing its pain and frustration with the survivors that challenge it.
When the monster is driven off, it will sink its spiteful claws even deeper. Leaving the settlement in perpetual suffering, they are forced to pursue the spiteful creature. The monster awaits them dangerously out of reach on the ceiling of a deadly, jagged landscape. The survivors must climb, hang, swing, and fly to meet the monster in a perspective-breaking upside-down showdown.
