# BLACK KNIGHT

The Black Knight is a brand-new nemesis monster for Kingdom Death: Monster. Beautifully presented with high-quality, upgraded components.
At the tolling of the strange bell, the settlement feels the inescapable call to face the feral guardian that awaits in the cliffside sanctuary.
A chaotic, ruinous battle ensues in the claustrophobic remains of the Black Knight's citadel. Stand your ground against the rage of the heavy-handed Black Knight or scramble to survive as you careen off the edge of the inverted mountain.
Victory will give you a glimpse into the once-great artifices of the Black Knight order. Defeat will leave no trace of your ill-fated fall.
Black Knight in your Monster Campaign
The Black Knight is a node 3 nemesis monster and takes the place of the Hand in your core game campaign.
A settlement menaced by the Black Knight nemesis will face  new settlement events, story events, and a unique ascent to face the Black Knight in its domain.
Squires of the Citadel Campaign
This expansion also includes a 5 lantern year campaign exploring the secretive life of the squires that scurry in the shadows of the citadel. Play five custom lantern years to unlock the secrets of the Black Knight order.
Using ready-to-play gear grids, survivor vignette cards, and new components for core game monsters to tell the tale of four dutybound squires ekeing out their existence under the auspices of the restless guardian. The gleaming rulebook includes a Squire campaign section filled with rules and story events to guide you through the squire's tale. Survive five uniquely designed lantern years to learn the secrets and ultimate fates of Cain, Iola, Elle, and Owen.
