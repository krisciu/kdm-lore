# BLACK KNIGHT

## Overview

The Black Knight is a nemesis monster for Kingdom Death: Monster, serving as a node 3 nemesis that replaces the Hand in the core game campaign. [black-knight-expansion.txt] (confirmed)

## Lore

At the tolling of the strange bell, the settlement feels the inescapable call to face the feral guardian that awaits in the cliffside sanctuary. [black-knight-expansion.txt] (confirmed)

A chaotic, ruinous battle ensues in the claustrophobic remains of the Black Knight's citadel. Survivors must stand their ground against the rage of the heavy-handed Black Knight or scramble to survive as they careen off the edge of the inverted mountain. [black-knight-expansion.txt] (confirmed)

Victory will give survivors a glimpse into the once-great artifices of the Black Knight order. Defeat will leave no trace of their ill-fated fall. [black-knight-expansion.txt] (confirmed)

### Squires of the Citadel Campaign

This expansion also includes a 5 lantern year campaign exploring the secretive life of the squires that scurry in the shadows of the citadel. [black-knight-expansion.txt] (confirmed)
