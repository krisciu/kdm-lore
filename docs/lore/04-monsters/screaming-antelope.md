# Screaming Antelope

> *"Devourer"*

**Category:** Monster  
**Type:** Quarry (Node 2)  
**Expansion:** Core Game

---

## Overview

The Screaming Antelope is one of the primary quarry monsters that survivors must hunt to ensure their settlement's survival. Classified as a Node 2 quarry, it represents a significant step up in danger from the White Lion that most settlements first encounter. Its epithet—"Devourer"—hints at the creature's terrible hunger and the threat it poses to any who cross its path.

As a core game monster, the Screaming Antelope serves as a crucial milestone in a settlement's development. The resources harvested from successful hunts allow survivors to craft the distinctive Screaming Fur armor, a vital defensive upgrade that can mean the difference between life and death in future encounters. The creature occupies a pivotal position in the campaign's progression, representing both a necessary challenge and a gateway to greater power.

## Role in the Settlement

The Screaming Antelope provides expanding settlements with essential materials and opportunities for growth. Survivors who successfully bring down this beast can harvest components used to create the Screaming Fur armor kit, one of the foundational armor sets that settlements can craft. This armor represents a significant improvement over starting equipment and the more basic Rawhide armor available earlier in a campaign.

## Campaign Significance

Within the structure of Kingdom Death: Monster campaigns, the Screaming Antelope occupies the Node 2 quarry position—a tier that offers meaningful challenge while providing resources critical for settlement development. This position in the campaign structure means that settlements may choose alternative paths; both the Flower Knight and the Spidicules expansions offer replacement quarries for this node, each bringing their own unique challenges, rewards, and thematic elements.

*[Speculation: The creature's title "Devourer" and its screaming nature suggest a monster driven by insatiable hunger, likely featuring gameplay mechanics centered around consumption and terrifying vocalizations.]*
