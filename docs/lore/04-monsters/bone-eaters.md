# Bone Eaters

> *"Unrelenting. Insatiable."*

**Category:** Monster  
**Type:** Encounter Monster (Quarry)  
**Expansion:** Gambler's Chest

## Overview

The Bone Eaters represent a terrifying new classification of threat in the darkness: the Encounter Monster. Unlike traditional quarry that survivors deliberately seek out, these creatures are met during the perilous journey of the hunt itself, transforming what was already a dangerous expedition into a desperate fight for survival before the true showdown even begins.

Described as "unrelenting" and "insatiable," the Bone Eaters hunt in packs, descending upon survivors with a singular, horrifying purpose—to consume the very framework of their prey. Their appearance during a hunt forces survivors into a mini-showdown, a brutal skirmish that carries with it the potential for triumph or utter ruin. Those who fall to the Bone Eaters never reach their intended quarry; their bones stripped clean and devoured in the endless dark.

The introduction of Encounter Monsters through the Bone Eaters fundamentally changes the rhythm of the hunt, adding layers of danger that survivors must prepare for beyond merely reaching their destination.

## Physical Description

*[Speculative based on name and context]* The Bone Eaters are pack creatures, suggesting a coordinated, predatory intelligence. Their name implies a specialized diet—or perhaps a ritualistic consumption—of skeletal material, making survivors and their accumulated resources alike targets for these insatiable horrors. The "Bone Eaters crest" artwork by Lokman Lam depicts the intricate heraldry of these monsters, suggesting they possess a defined, almost regal identity among the creatures of the darkness.

## Hunt Behavior

The Bone Eaters are unique in their role as obstacles encountered before the primary quarry. When survivors cross paths with a pack of Bone Eaters, they must engage in a variant showdown utilizing new encounter monster mechanics specific to this type of threat. This engagement is not optional—the pack's unrelenting nature ensures that survivors cannot simply flee or avoid confrontation.

Victory against the Bone Eaters may yield rewards or advantages for the hunt ahead. Defeat, however, can spell disaster—survivors may be killed, wounded, or so depleted of resources that continuing to the true quarry becomes impossible.

## Lore Significance

The existence of Encounter Monsters like the Bone Eaters suggests the darkness between settlements and hunting grounds is far more populated with horrors than previously understood. These creatures occupy an ecological niche as ambush predators, exploiting the vulnerability of survivors who have left the relative safety of their settlement but have not yet reached their destination.

Their insatiable hunger for bones—the very architecture of living things—speaks to a deeper symbolic horror. In the world of Kingdom Death, bones are resources, crafting materials, and the literal foundation upon which survivors build their desperate existence. The Bone Eaters threaten not just life, but legacy.
