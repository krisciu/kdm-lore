# FROGDOG

The Frogdog is a new cornerstone quarry monster for Kingdom Death: Monster.
Barks and croaks in the darkness coalesce into a plaintive song. A putrid foe lurks at the start of your campaign.
Cagey and revolting the monster leaps into action. The monster's unique physiology creates wobbling bubbles of stench that pursue the bioelectric hum of survivors as they take to the air in pursuit of the incomprehensible behemoth.
Victory provides a burgeoning settlement with a surprising new set of tools for survival.
Frogdog in your Monster Campaign
The Frogdog is a node 1 quarry monster and takes the place of the White Lion in your core game campaign.
A settlement's starting monster shapes their journey. Settlements hunting the Frogdog have discover new gear, fighting arts, and more that will drastically change your campaign from the very start.
A host of new monster hunt events await the wary survivors in their perilous pursuit of their quarry. Survivors may even try their hands at a new special hunt event, probing the murky waters for strange resources.
As your campaign surpasses even the mightiest Frogdogs a new threat emerges in the dark.
Bullfrogdog Tusked Horror
The Bullfrogdog is a variant of the Frogdog lurking at the farthest edges of the darkness. Tusked Bullfrogdogs are a whole new beast, including new AI, HL, and resource cards to create a completely different showdown experience. The survivors may pursue the powerfully toothy beast to unlock an entirely new arsenal of gear and armor suited for later stages of your campaign.
