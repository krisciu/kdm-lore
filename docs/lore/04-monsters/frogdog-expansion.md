# Frogdog

## Overview

The Frogdog is a cornerstone quarry monster for Kingdom Death: Monster, serving as a node 1 quarry that replaces the White Lion in the core game campaign [batch-scraped/frogdog-expansion.txt]. This putrid beast lurks at the start of a settlement's journey, offering new survivors their first taste of the horrors awaiting them in the darkness (confirmed).

## Lore

Barks and croaks in the darkness coalesce into a plaintive song. A putrid foe lurks at the start of your campaign [batch-scraped/frogdog-expansion.txt] (confirmed).

The Frogdog lurks in overgrown pools. Its indiscriminate appetite creates turbulent accumulation of gases in its distended gut. When threatened, the monster weaponizes its gas to ruin its enemies then leaps into the darkness powered by its well-muscled legs [quarry-expansions/frogdog-expansion.txt] (confirmed).

Cagey and revolting, the monster leaps into action. The monster's unique physiology creates wobbling bubbles of stench that pursue the bioelectric hum of survivors as they take to the air in pursuit of the incomprehensible behemoth [batch-scraped/frogdog-expansion.txt] (confirmed).

## Campaign Role

This monster is the first monster awaiting the newly awoken survivors in their journey [quarry-expansions/frogdog-expansion.txt] (confirmed).

A settlement's starting monster shapes their journey. Settlements hunting the Frogdog discover new gear, fighting arts, and more that will drastically change the campaign from the very start [batch-scraped/frogdog-expansion.txt] (confirmed).

Victory provides a burgeoning settlement with a surprising new set of tools for survival [batch-scraped/frogdog-expansion.txt] (confirmed).

### Hunt Events

A host of new monster hunt events await wary survivors in their perilous pursuit of their quarry. Survivors may even try their hands at a new special hunt event, probing the murky waters for strange resources [batch-scraped/frogdog-expansion.txt] (confirmed).

### Bullfrogdog Variant

As your campaign surpasses even the mightiest Frogdogs, a new threat emerges in the dark [batch-scraped/frogdog-expansion.txt] (confirmed).

The Bullfrogdog is a variant of the Frogdog lurking at the farthest edges of the darkness. Tusked Bullfrogdogs are described as a whole new beast, including new AI, HL, and resource cards to create a completely different showdown experience. The survivors may pursue the powerfully toothy beast to unlock an entirely new arsenal of gear and armor suited for later stages of the campaign (speculative—referenced in original entry but not verified in available source excerpts).
