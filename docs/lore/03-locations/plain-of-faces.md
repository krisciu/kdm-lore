# The Plain of Faces

The Plain of Faces is the primary setting of Kingdom Death: Monster - a nightmarish expanse of stone faces stretching endlessly into the darkness.

## The Scribe

The Scribe is the power behind the Kings and their armies. To men, he is a god made flesh, appearing in repose atop his throne with his tome hoisted by a grotesque tableau of slaves. In his book his words are writ into reality, sowing the seeds of small human settlements into existence with the stroke of his quill. Once the humans grow and reproduce the Scribe will return to harvest his crop.

*Part of the Lantern Festival Expansion*

## The King

The rhythmic scrape and clang of the King's Men's march heralds the arrival of the King. The King's ornate carapace is wrapped in shifting robes that hide the ravenous creature within. Everyone in the King's path is consumed without mercy as the King's Men look on from behind their passive, cherub masks.

## The Hand

The Hand are the King's highest ranking guard. They see through the eyes of every King's Man that patrols the King's territory. The Hands are highly intelligent and master swordsmen.

*Core Game*

## King's Man

The King's Men herald the appearance of powerful entities such as the Scribe and the King. From a distance the strangely fashioned lantern halberds are glowing harbingers of the mountainous King lumbering behind.
