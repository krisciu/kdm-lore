## 📖 Lore Discoveries

### Connections Found

1. **White Lion → Gold Smoke Knight Connection**
   - White Lions may be related to or precursors of the Gold Smoke Knight
   - Evidence: Visual similarities, narrative placement

2. **The Entity's Grand Plan**
   - The Entity appears to cultivate humanity across multiple settlements
   - Campaigns may represent "harvest cycles"
   - Evidence: Cyclical nature of game, Entity's involvement in survivor creation

3. **Multiple Reality Theory**
   - Evidence suggests overlapping timelines/dimensions
   - The Lantern Festival may allow glimpses of alternate realities
   - Characters appearing across eras supports this

### Open Questions

- What is the true nature of the stone faces?
- How do survivors reproduce without the Entity?
- What happened to the "old civilization" hinted at in the Great City?
- Is the Dragon King connected to the Sunstalker?
