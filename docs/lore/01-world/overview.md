# World Overview

> *"There is no sky. There is no sun. There is only darkness, and within it, us."*

## The Nature of Reality

The Kingdom Death universe exists in a state of perpetual darkness. This is not merely nighttime—there is no concept of day. The world is an endless expanse of stone, shadow, and horror.

### Fundamental Characteristics

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Light** | None naturally; all light comes from lanterns |
| **Ground** | The Plain of Faces—endless stone faces |
| **Sky** | Impenetrable blackness |
| **Time** | Measured in Lantern Years, not solar cycles |
| **Physics** | Familiar but subtly wrong |

## The Plain of Faces

The most common terrain is the Plain of Faces—an endless expanse of stone ground composed of countless face-like formations. These faces:

- Vary in size from tiny to massive
- Show expressions of anguish, peace, or blankness
- May or may not be the remains of something living
- Occasionally birth new survivors

### Origin Theories

1. **Compressed Humanity** - The faces are the remnants of a previous civilization
2. **Entity Creation** - The Entity formed the world from human essence
3. **Dream Manifestation** - Reality is shaped by collective unconscious fear
4. **Geological Natural** - Simply the natural stone of this dimension

## The Darkness

Darkness in Kingdom Death is not empty—it is full:

- **Monsters** lurk just beyond perception
- **Strange sounds** echo from unknowable distances
- **The feeling of being watched** is constant
- **Reality itself** seems unstable at the edges of light

### Surviving the Dark

Lanterns are essential:
- The only reliable light source
- Created from monster parts (fat, organs)
- May have mystical properties
- Define the boundary between survival and death

## Life in the World

### Survivors
Humans who exist in this world:
- May be born from the stone faces
- May awaken with no memory
- Must hunt monsters to survive
- Build settlements for protection

### Monsters
The dominant life form:
- Range from bestial to godlike
- Some may have once been human
- Others are clearly alien
- All are deadly

### Other Entities
Beyond monsters, greater powers exist:
- **The Entity** (or "The Other") - A cosmic creative force
- **The King** - A humanoid power of unknown purpose
- **Various gods and demons** hinted at in lore

## Cosmology

### The Nature of the Universe

Multiple theories exist:
1. **Pocket Dimension** - A created space, not a full universe
2. **Dream Reality** - The world exists within something's dream
3. **Post-Apocalyptic** - The remains of a destroyed reality
4. **Testing Ground** - A crucible designed to forge/harvest humanity

### Connection to Other Realities
Evidence suggests:
- Other dimensions may exist
- Time may not be linear
- The "real world" may be inaccessible or nonexistent
- Lanterns may connect to something beyond

## The Role of Humanity

In this world, humans are:
- **Prey** - The default state; monsters hunt survivors
- **Crafters** - Capable of turning monster parts into tools
- **Builders** - Able to create settlements and civilization
- **Unknown Purpose** - May exist for a reason beyond survival

### The Great Question
> Why does humanity exist in this world? Were they created? Placed here? Are they indigenous? The answer remains one of Kingdom Death's central mysteries.
