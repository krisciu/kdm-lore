# World Overview

> *"There is no sky. There is no sun. There is only darkness, and within it, us."* (unverified quote)

---

## Overview

The Kingdom Death universe is a setting of perpetual darkness where humanity exists as survivors struggling against monstrous threats. Survivors eke out an existence in the "overwhelming darkness" [kingdom-death-monster-1-6], building settlements and hunting monsters to craft the tools needed for survival. The world is characterized by its stone-faced ground, the essential nature of lanterns, and the constant threat of deadly creatures.

## The Nature of Reality

The Kingdom Death universe exists in a state of perpetual darkness [kingdom-death-monster-1-6]. This is not merely nighttime—there appears to be no concept of day (speculative). The world is an expanse of stone, shadow, and horror.

### Fundamental Characteristics

| Aspect | Description | Confidence |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Light** | Lanterns are essential; survivors carry them [10th-anniversary-survivors] | Confirmed |
| **Ground** | Stone-faced ground [indomitable-survivor-roaring-harmonica-kale] | Confirmed |
| **Sky** | Darkness extends above [indomitable-survivor-tyrant-slayer-scarlet] | Confirmed |
| **Time** | Measured in Lantern Years [kingdom-death-monster-1-6] | Confirmed |
| **Physics** | Familiar but subtly wrong | Speculative |

## The Stone-Faced Ground

The most common terrain described in the sources is "stone-faced ground"—referenced consistently across multiple survivor accounts [indomitable-survivor-roaring-harmonica-kale] [indomitable-survivor-poison-partisan-ritika] [indomitable-survivor-tachyon-nodachi-rubi]. This ground features:

- Face-like formations in the stone (confirmed)
- Unknown origin and purpose (speculative)

### Origin Theories (All Speculative)

1. **Compressed Humanity** - The faces are the remnants of a previous civilization
2. **Entity Creation** - A cosmic force formed the world from human essence
3. **Dream Manifestation** - Reality is shaped by collective unconscious fear
4. **Geological Natural** - Simply the natural stone of this dimension

## The Darkness

Darkness in Kingdom Death is pervasive—survivors live their lives "in the darkness" [10th-anniversary-survivors] and must "endure the darkness" to survive [10th-anniversary-survivors]. Monsters stalk this darkness [dragon-king-expansion-1-6].

Characteristics of the darkness (speculative unless noted):
- **Monsters** lurk within it [dragon-king-expansion-1-6] (confirmed)
- **Strange sounds** echo from unknowable distances (speculative)
- **The feeling of being watched** is constant (speculative)
- **Reality itself** seems unstable at the edges of light (speculative)

### Surviving the Dark

Lanterns are essential:
- Referenced as a constant companion of survivors [10th-anniversary-survivors]
- Time itself is measured in "Lantern Years" [kingdom-death-monster-1-6]
- May be created from monster parts (likely, based on crafting systems)
- The "Blue Lantern" exists as rare gear [allison-the-twilight-knight] (confirmed)

## Life in the World

### Survivors
Humans who exist in this world [kingdom-death-monster-1-6]:
- Eke out an existence in the overwhelming darkness (confirmed)
- Must hunt monsters to survive (confirmed)
- Build settlements for protection [dragon-king-expansion-1-6] (confirmed)
- Craft gear from monster resources [kingdom-death-monster-1-6] (confirmed)
- May awaken with no memory (speculative)
- May be born from the stone faces (speculative)

### Monsters
The dominant threat in the world:
- Serve as quarry for survivors to hunt [dragon-king-expansion-1-6] (confirmed)
- Range in difficulty levels [kingdom-death-monster-1-6] (confirmed)
- Include nemesis monsters that menace settlements [black-knight-expansion] (confirmed)
- Their bodies provide resources for crafting gear [dragon-king-expansion-1-6] (confirmed)
- Some may have once been human (speculative)

### Other Entities
Beyond monsters, greater powers may exist (speculative unless noted):
- **The King** - Referenced as content in expansions [gamblers-chest-expansion] (confirmed existence)

## Geography (Speculative)

Limited geographic information is confirmed in available sources. The following locations are referenced or speculated:

**Confirmed References:**

- Settlements (built by survivors)
- Cliffside locations [black-knight-expansion]

**Speculative Locations:**
- Holy Lands
- Abyssal Woods
- The Void
- The Great City
- Ringtail Swamp

## Cosmology (Largely Speculative)

### The Nature of the Universe

Multiple theories exist, all speculative:
1. **Pocket Dimension** - A created space, not a full universe
2. **Dream Reality** - The world exists within something's dream
3. **Post-Apocalyptic** - The remains of a destroyed reality
4. **Testing Ground** - A crucible designed to forge/harvest humanity

### Connection to Other Realities
Speculative theories suggest:
- Other dimensions may exist
- Time may not be linear
- Lanterns may connect to something beyond

## The Role of Humanity

In this world, humans are:
- **Survivors** - The term used consistently [kingdom-death-monster-1-6] (confirmed)
- **Prey** - Monsters hunt and kill survivors (confirmed)
- **Crafters** - Capable of turning monster parts into gear [kingdom-death-monster-1-6] (confirmed)
- **Builders** - Able to create settlements [dragon-king-expansion-1-6] (confirmed)
- **Unknown Purpose** - May exist for a reason beyond survival (speculative)

### The Great Question
> Why does humanity exist in this world? Were they created? Placed here? Are they indigenous? The answer remains one of Kingdom Death's central mysteries. (speculative)
