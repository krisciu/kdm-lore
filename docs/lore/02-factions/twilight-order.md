## Theories

> The Order may have been founded by survivors who learned to fight back against the darkness. Their presence "on the edge of the known world" suggests they operate in frontier regions between settlements and monster territories.

### Organizational Scale (Confidence: Speculative)
> The use of plural "Twilight Knights" [allison-the-twilight-knight.txt] suggests multiple members exist, indicating a formal organization rather than a single individual.

### Connection to Other Factions (Confidence: Speculative)
