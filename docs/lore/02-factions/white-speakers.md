## Overview

## Origins: The Prince of Swords

There was a settlement of humans so powerful that they defied one of the great entities. In response, the entity drank their only lake and waited for them to turn to dust. Undaunted, the humans grew plants rich in water and survived. (speculative - external source)

The furious entity took up its mantle and invaded, wiping out the humans. It left one man as a warning, cursed with an unslakable thirst. (speculative - external source)

Desperate to end his suffering, the man took up the sword, mastering it with single-minded focus. Exactly 1000 years to the day, the Prince of the Sword stood triumphant over the dying entity. Drinking its blood quenched his thirst for the first time but did not end his torment. Eternally he wanders drinking the blood of worthy adversaries to momentarily satisfy his thirst.

## The Cult

White Speakers tell secret stories that empower the cult's blood magic. [red-witches-expansion.txt] (confirmed) Those who tell the story of the Prince of Swords seek the taste of blood stains and remnants of gore on ancient weapons. In this way they gain the prowess of their former wielders. (speculative - external source)

Settlements that innovate storytelling often receive visits from White Speakers. [pariah-expansion.txt] (confirmed) Small covens of White Speakers can be found meeting in abandoned places, sharing the secrets of their blood magic, passed on from one White Speaker to another through intricate tales, whispered and screamed in frenzied, transcendental rituals. (speculative - external source)

Long ago, the White Speaker cult's savagery threatened the few enclaves of human civilization. The Order of Twilight Knights rose up, nearly destroying the cult. (speculative - external source)

## The Red Witches

The Red Witches are a squad of White Speakers acting in tandem as cult enforcers. A trio of enforcers, they arrive without mercy in pursuit of the White Speaker cult's most notorious runaways. [red-witches-expansion.txt] (confirmed)

The Red Witches are dispatched by the White Speaker cult to hunt and destroy their enemies. They roam the plain of stone faces searching for signs of their greatest foe, mercilessly upheaving settlements that cross their paths. [red-witches-expansion.txt] (confirmed)

Each Red Witch has a distinct fighting style and unique expression of the cult's blood magic:
- **Braal** - Bellicose, leads the initial assault
- **Nico** - Cruel, follows Braal
- **Seer** - Otherworldly, arrives for climactic encounters; maintains a sanctum where audiences may be sought

## The Pariah

The Pariah has a violent relationship with the White Speakers. Their influence over settlements is unwelcome to the cult, and the Pariah's violence against the White Speakers is not welcome news for the merciless squad. [pariah-expansion.txt] (confirmed)

The Pariah offers settlements questionable patterns for gear created by corrupted blood magic. Understanding milestones formerly guided by the White Speakers can be transformed through the Pariah's perspective. [pariah-expansion.txt] (confirmed)
