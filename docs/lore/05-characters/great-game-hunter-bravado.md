# Great Game Hunter - Bravado

Limit 1 per customer
Illustrated by master character designer Yasmine Putri in 2013, we are excited to finally reveal an advance class, the Great Game Hunter Bravado sculpture. In the original version of Kingdom Death, which was more hero focused and many years before 'Monster' was created, the Great Game Hunters were designed to be a playable class. Nobels from the only standing city within the darkness!
A Bravado type Great Game Hunter is the most cocksure of the class variants, wandering solo into the unknown with more primitive hunting weapons, somtimes even joining survivors on their quests for resources, to prove to other members of their house that they are the best. Physically strong with vast education and experience to back them up they delight in felling prey alone that would normally take a Great Game Hunter and their retinue of slaves to manage.Early game design notes from 2007: The most physically fit of all Great Game Hunters. A built in confidence & boasting mechanic powers up early game weapons as they rack up their kill count. With their crowning skill allowing them to dump their confidence pool into attacks that are effective against boss monsters, often leaving them debilitated while the GGH Bravado boasts (leaving the other party members able to take advantage of the moment).
