# Indomitable Survivor - Tyrant Slayer Scarlet

They rocketed into the darkness above, Scarlet gripping the reticulated horns of the monster as the rushing air threatened to tear her off. From below, a wobbling arrow took flight as the the ground beneath melted into a pool of roiling lava. The arrow struck true, piercing the monster's distended gut. With a subsonic rumble of despair the monster was suddenly limp, plummeting to the ground. Scarlet released her grip, falling toward the boiling ground with her outstretched weapon readied in vain hope.
