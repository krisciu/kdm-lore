# Deathmas - Cockroach Queen

The guest had arrived and they felt merry and bright despite the gloomy frost that descended on the settlement. Their joints ached and their blue-tinged skin stung in the biting winds. Barely audible above the howl of the wind and the glad tidings bellowed by their guest, a papery tune emerged. They gathered, pressed together for warmth to sing the carol they each knew in their hearts without ever hearing it. On the first glow of Deathmas our best guest gave to us... The guest grew quiet, listening intently, closing its eyes and searching the back of its eyelids for a memory. With a rising hiss, its appendages began to twitch and sway along to the chorus.
