# Indomitable Survivor - Poison Partisan Ritika

Unsteady on its remaining legs, the monster's body sunk low against the stone faced ground. A greasy miasma emanated from the monster's battered body, choking her lungs and burning her eyes. Legions of newly hatched spiderlings, converged voraciously on the phenomenal call of its progenitor. Their coarse legs scrabbled over Ritika's body, talons slicing her flesh in their fevered rush. The monster hesitated, rising above her ravenous brood. Ritika held fast to its spindly fingers. Throwing her weight over the monsters swaying body, she hacked at the exposed joint, toppling the creature for a final time. The swarming brood descended on the corpse, devouring its broken body. One by one she smashed and stabbed the spiderlings until the skittering dark grew still. With the last of her strength she yanked the florid organ from the corpse, retching its oily stench.
