With so much emphasis on player choice, no two campaign are alike.Monsters vs PlayersFight 8 monsters with rising levels of difficulty (except for the finale, it has only 1 level and it's HARD!) Every encounter, even with the same monster, is diverse and valuable. No two showdowns will resolve the same way. Players will have to plan their gear and keep their minds sharp to prevail.
