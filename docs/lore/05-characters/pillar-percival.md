# Pillar - Percival

Percival was a member of a small order called the Black Knights. The Black Knights were founded by a militaristic settlement that hoped to conquer the darkness and provide a safe haven for all. A great crusade called the Black Knights into action and Percival left her home, never to be seen again.
Before leaving, though, she commanded her loyal companion, a young puppy, to wait for her safe return. It still waits to this day.
Pillar - Percival is packaged in a uniquely designed graphical box and includes:
1x Percival hard plastic miniature
1x Kingdom Death 30mm base
1x Pillar hunt event card
1x Secret fighting art card
1x Pillar card
1x Pillar card install guide
1x Large matte art print
