# Lucy

> *"One extinguishing lantern after another, the grizzled foursome persevered."*

**Category:** Character
**Type:** Starting Survivor
**Expansion:** Core Game (10th Anniversary Survivors variant)

---

## Overview

Lucy stands among the original four survivors who first opened their eyes in the darkness, emerging from oblivion with nothing but the dim glow of a dying lantern and the monstrous bulk of the White Lion before them. Alongside Allister, Zachary, and Erza, she represents the fragile spark of humanity struggling against an incomprehensible nightmare world—the very foundation upon which settlements are built or destroyed.

The 10th Anniversary reimagining of Lucy presents her not as the vulnerable, newly-awakened soul of the original figures, but as something far more formidable. A full lantern decade into her survival, Lucy embodies the ingenuity and grit that separates those who merely exist in the darkness from those who learn to thrive within it. The insight she has gleaned from countless hunts, showdowns, and settlement crises has crystallized into something rare and precious—a spark of true crafting inspiration.

## History

Lucy's earliest moments of consciousness remain shrouded in the same primordial mystery that veils all survivors' origins. She awoke alongside three others in absolute darkness, surrounded by stone faces frozen in silent screams, with only the fading light of a lantern herd to push back the void. What came before—if anything came before—is lost to the darkness itself.

The first test came immediately: the White Lion, a beast of terrible beauty and savage hunger. Whether through desperate cooperation, raw instinct, or blind fortune, Lucy and her companions survived that initial encounter. From the lion's remains, they fashioned their first crude tools and weapons. From its blood-soaked victory, they learned the first lesson of their world: in the darkness, death feeds life.

A lantern decade is no small measure of time in a world where extinction lurks behind every shadow. That Lucy persevered through ten years—watching lanterns extinguish one after another, witnessing the rise and fall of fellow survivors, enduring horrors that would shatter lesser minds—speaks to an iron core beneath her human exterior. The sources describe her and her original companions as "grizzled," a word that carries the weight of countless scars, both visible and hidden.

## The Spark of Ingenuity

What distinguishes the 10th Anniversary Lucy from her earlier incarnation is not merely survival, but evolution. The source material speaks of "insight gleaned from their life in the darkness" that has "ignited a spark of ingenuity." This manifests mechanically through the Seed Pattern system—crafting inspirations that accompany hard-won insight about the world.

*[Speculative]* In narrative terms, this suggests Lucy has transcended mere reactive survival. Where once she fought with found bones and scavenged stone, she now perceives deeper patterns in the materials around her. The monster parts that others see as mere resources, she recognizes as components waiting to be assembled into something new. When survivors in her settlement reach moments of profound understanding about their world, Lucy's influence helps transform that knowledge into tangible innovation.

## Physical Description

*[Note: Specific visual details beyond the general description are not provided in sources]*

The 10th Anniversary figure of Lucy was designed by artist Lokman Lam and sculpted by Team Death. She is presented on a unique scenic base insert, suggesting her figure depicts a specific moment or environment from her decade of survival. The commemorative artwork, available as a large matte print on heavy card stock, captures her reimagined appearance after ten years of enduring the darkness.

## Lore Significance

Lucy occupies a unique position in Kingdom Death lore as both an everywoman and a legend. As a starting survivor, she represents the blank slate—any player's first steps into the nightmare. As a 10th Anniversary figure, she represents the aspirational endpoint: proof that survival is possible, that humanity can adapt, that the darkness does not always win.

Her connection to the Seed Pattern system positions her as a font of crafting wisdom. The patterns themselves represent "a spark of crafting inspiration that accompanies insight gleaned about the world." In a setting where innovation means the difference between extinction and continuation, Lucy's evolved understanding of materials and construction makes her invaluable to any settlement fortunate enough to benefit from her experience.
