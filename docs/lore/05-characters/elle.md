# Elle

> *"The novice's hands tremble not from fear, but from the weight of devotions yet unlearned."*

**Category:** Character
**Type:** Squire / Playable Survivor
**Expansion:** Black Knight Expansion

## Overview

Elle is one of the four dutybound squires whose desperate existence unfolds within the Squires of the Citadel campaign. Bearing the designation of **Novice acolyte**, she represents the spiritual and devotional aspect of the Black Knight order—a soul still learning the strange rites and dark observances that once defined the citadel's purpose.

Among her fellow squires, Elle occupies a unique position: neither hardened warrior, nor master craftsman, nor unbreakable survivor, but rather a keeper of knowledge still in its nascent form. Her novitiate suggests recent induction into mysteries that the citadel's crumbling halls can barely contain, making her both vulnerable and potentially vital to understanding the secrets that lie within the Black Knight's domain.

## Role Among the Squires

The four squires of the citadel each fulfill distinct roles in their precarious existence beneath the restless guardian's shadow. Where Cain serves as the stalwart vanguard and Owen provides unbreakable resilience, Elle's purpose as novice acolyte implies a connection to the ritual and spiritual foundations of the Black Knight order.

*Speculation: As an acolyte, Elle may possess knowledge of ceremonies, observances, or sacred traditions that sustained the "once-great artifices" of the order. Her novice status suggests she is still learning these rites, perhaps from fragmentary texts or half-remembered practices passed down through the citadel's decline.*

## The Squires of the Citadel

Elle's fate is revealed through the five-lantern-year Squires of the Citadel campaign, a self-contained narrative experience using ready-to-play gear grids and survivor vignette cards. Players guide all four squires—Cain, Iola, Elle, and Owen—through uniquely designed lantern years, facing core game monsters reimagined through new components and story events.

The campaign explores the "secretive life" of these dutybound servants as they eke out existence under the auspices of the Black Knight. Their survival is tenuous, their duties obscure, and their ultimate fates tied to the dark secrets of the order itself.

## Lore Significance

Elle embodies the spiritual continuity of a fallen order. In Kingdom Death's cosmos, where knowledge is precious and easily lost, a novice acolyte represents both hope and tragedy—the desperate attempt to preserve wisdom even as the institution that created it crumbles into ruin. Her presence among the squires suggests the Black Knight order was more than mere martial might; it possessed rites and traditions worthy of devoted study.

The inverted mountain's cliffside sanctuary, with its claustrophobic remains, serves as both temple and tomb for whatever devotions Elle practices. Whether her acolyte's path leads to enlightenment or oblivion remains to be discovered through the campaign's events.
