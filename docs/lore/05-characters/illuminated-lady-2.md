# Illuminated Lady 2

Limit 1 per customer
They appear at the settlement's edge. Visions of desire. Radiating benevolence, beckoning with compassion, embodying longing. Their solitary appearance casts doubt on a survivors sanity. Eventually the entire settlement will confess their own unique vision of the creatures. Moved by desire but wary of their purpose, the settlement wonders what purpose the illuminated figures serve.
