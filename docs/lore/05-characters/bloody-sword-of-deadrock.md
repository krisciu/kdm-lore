## Overview

The Bloody Sword of Deadrock is a narrative sculpture character introduced in the Gambler's Chest expansion for Kingdom Death: Monster. Listed among 46 character sculptures, this figure represents one of the wandering souls tied to the mysterious location known as Deadrock—a place significant enough to produce multiple named individuals within the expansion's roster.

As part of the Gambler's Chest's Character System, the Bloody Sword of Deadrock likely serves as a Wanderer whose story can intertwine with a settlement's own desperate tale of survival. The epithet "Bloody Sword" suggests a warrior of considerable violence and renown, their reputation steeped in crimson deeds.

## The Name and Its Implications

*[Speculative interpretation based on naming conventions]*

The title "Bloody Sword" carries dark connotations within Kingdom Death's brutal setting. This is not a name given to the merciful or the hesitant. It speaks of a blade perpetually wet, of combat so frequent that the iron never knows dryness. Whether this individual earned their name through heroic defense of Deadrock or through darker, more predatory acts remains unknown.

The "of Deadrock" designation connects this character to a specific location, alongside the **Bowmaster of Deadrock**—suggesting Deadrock may be a settlement, outpost, or significant landmark that has produced multiple notable survivors. The pairing of a sword-wielder and a bow-master implies Deadrock may have developed martial traditions or faced threats requiring such specialized defenders.

## Lore Significance

*[Speculative]*

The existence of named characters tied to specific locations hints at a broader world beyond the isolated lantern-light of a single settlement. Deadrock and its warriors suggest that pockets of humanity—or something resembling it—persist elsewhere in the darkness, each with their own histories of survival and bloodshed.

The Bloody Sword's potential arrival as a Wanderer could represent many things: a refugee from a fallen stronghold, a mercenary seeking purpose, or perhaps something more sinister—a killer whose appetites brought ruin to their homeland and now seeks new hunting grounds.

## Connections

- **Bowmaster of Deadrock** — Fellow survivor from the Deadrock location; likely shares history and possibly conflicting loyalties
- **Deadrock** — Location of origin; nature and current state unknown
- **Wanderer System** — Mechanical framework through which this character likely interacts with settlements
- **Character System** — The Gambler's Chest system that gives characters "enduring appeal"
