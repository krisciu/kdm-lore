# Indomitable Survivor - Roaring Harmonica Kale

The shaggy beast opened its jaws, revealing row upon row of glistening teeth. It gripped the stone-faced ground with its exhausted hands, releasing a terrifying roar. The bowel-shaking rumble grew into a head-splitting assault. Kale shuddered, bathed in the roar of his doom. His body sprang into one final act of defiance, throwing himself headlong at the howling maw. A massive pale hand fell lifeless across Kale's heaving body. The beast slumped over his blade, frozen in a silent roar.
