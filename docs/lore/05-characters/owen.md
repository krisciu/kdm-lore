# Owen

> *"Unbreakable."*

**Category:** Character
**Type:** Squire
**Expansion:** Black Knight

---

## Overview

Owen is one of four dutybound squires who serve within the crumbling confines of the Black Knight's citadel. Known by the epithet "Unbreakable," Owen represents the resilient spirit necessary to endure the brutal existence demanded of those who dwell in the shadow of the restless guardian. His fate, along with that of his fellow squires, can be discovered through the harrowing events of the Squires of the Citadel campaign.

Little is known of Owen's origins or how he came to serve within the cliffside sanctuary. What is certain is that survival within the citadel demands extraordinary fortitude—a quality Owen embodies completely. While other squires contribute through martial prowess, craftsmanship, or spiritual devotion, Owen's defining characteristic speaks to something more primal: the sheer refusal to yield.

## The Unbreakable

Among the four squires of the citadel, each bears a title that speaks to their nature and role. Where Cain stands as the stalwart vanguard, Iola crafts as the master artisan, and Elle studies as the novice acolyte, Owen's designation of "Unbreakable" suggests a survivor of particular tenacity. In a world where every creature and circumstance conspires toward annihilation, to be unbreakable is perhaps the most essential quality of all.

*[Speculation: The title may indicate exceptional resilience in combat, an unyielding will, or perhaps a body that has endured wounds that would fell lesser survivors. Given Kingdom Death's dark themes, "Unbreakable" could also carry more sinister implications—a mind that cannot shatter even when it perhaps should.]*

## Life in the Citadel

Owen exists as part of a secretive order, scurrying through the shadows of the Black Knight's domain. The squires eke out their existence under the watchful auspices of the restless guardian—the feral Black Knight itself. Their lives are ones of duty and desperation, bound to service within the claustrophobic remains of what was once a far greater stronghold.

The citadel perches upon an inverted mountain, a sanctuary carved into the cliffside where a single misstep can send the unwary careening into the void below. It is within these treacherous confines that Owen and his fellow squires maintain their vigil across five harrowing lantern years.

## Lore Significance

Owen represents one facet of the human experience within Kingdom Death's nightmare world—the stubborn, defiant refusal to break. While the Black Knight expansion focuses primarily on the nemesis monster itself, the Squires of the Citadel campaign offers a rare glimpse into a structured society within the darkness, however precarious. Owen's role as the "Unbreakable" suggests that even in service to a feral guardian, individual identity and purpose can persist.

The fate that awaits Owen at the campaign's conclusion remains to be discovered through play, reinforcing Kingdom Death's themes of inevitable tragedy and the question of whether survival itself constitutes victory.
