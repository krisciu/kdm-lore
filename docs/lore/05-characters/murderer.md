# Murderer

> *"Some survivors hunt monsters. Others become them."*

**Category:** Character
**Type:** Narrative Sculpture
**Expansion:** Gambler's Chest

## Overview

The Murderer is a character miniature included among the 46 Narrative Sculptures in the Gambler's Chest expansion. As part of the expansion's Character System, the Murderer represents a survivor whose path has taken a particularly dark turn—one defined not by what they fight, but by who they have killed.

In a world where violence against monsters is survival, the Murderer's distinction speaks to something far more transgressive. This character embodies the grim reality that the greatest threat in the darkness of the Kingdom Death universe sometimes wears a human face.

## Speculation: Nature and Role

*The following is speculative based on the character's name and thematic context.*

The title "Murderer" suggests a survivor who has crossed a fundamental boundary—taking human life, possibly deliberately, possibly repeatedly. In settlements where every able body counts against the endless horrors beyond the lantern light, such an individual would be marked, feared, and perhaps even useful in ways others dare not contemplate.

Whether the Murderer represents a fallen hero consumed by trauma, a cold pragmatist who eliminated perceived threats to the settlement, or something more sinister entirely remains unknown. Their inclusion among the Narrative Sculptures indicates they likely have a story to tell through the Character System's mechanics.

## Lore Significance

The existence of a character explicitly named "Murderer" reinforces one of Kingdom Death's central themes: that survival in absolute darkness extracts terrible costs from the human soul. While other characters in the expansion bear titles reflecting skills (Bowmaster, Herb Gatherer) or circumstance (Dead Survivor, Tough Guy), the Murderer is defined purely by an act of ultimate transgression.
