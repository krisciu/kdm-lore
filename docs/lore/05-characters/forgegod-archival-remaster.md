# Forge God - Archival Remaster

Miniatures that defined the story of Kingdom Death emerge from the archives of death. Lovingly fine-tuned, adjusted to scale, and optimized for gorgeous modern materials.
The Forge God minds the furnaces of the Holy Lands, a massive creature who's very pores produce the holy steel used to forge the edifices of the Holy Lands. He is consumed by the desire for perfection in his works. The Mothers, Grandmothers and White Knights are his personal masterworks.
