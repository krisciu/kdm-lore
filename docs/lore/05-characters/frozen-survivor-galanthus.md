# Frozen Survivor - Galanthus

Galanthus bound his aching legs, bracing them for the burden. Better to move slowly, than to feel nothing as the cold takes your body piece by piece. Heaving the hefty pelts closer around his body, warmth crept back into his aching bones. He breathed into the hide shielding his face, smelling the monsters lingering stench mixed with his straining breath.
