# Cain

> *"Stalwart vanguard"*

**Category:** Character
**Type:** Named Survivor (Squire)
**Expansion:** Black Knight

---

## Overview

Cain is one of four dutybound squires whose story unfolds within the Squires of the Citadel campaign, a five lantern year narrative included with the Black Knight expansion. Designated the "stalwart vanguard" among his companions, Cain serves in the shadowed ruins of the citadel that clings to the inverted mountain—a claustrophobic sanctuary where the feral Black Knight maintains its restless vigil.

Little is known of how Cain came to dwell beneath the auspices of the restless guardian, but his role among the squires is clear: he stands at the fore, the first to meet whatever horrors emerge from the darkness. In a world where survival demands sacrifice, Cain has chosen—or been chosen for—the burden of being the shield that breaks first.

## Role Among the Squires

As the stalwart vanguard, Cain occupies a position of grim necessity among the four squires who scurry through the citadel's shadows. While Iola applies her mastery of craft, Elle pursues her arcane studies as a novice acolyte, and Owen endures through sheer unbreakable will, Cain's purpose is defensive vigilance. He is the wall upon which threats must first spend their fury.

The squires eke out their existence in service to the Black Knight order, bound by duties whose origins remain shrouded in the secretive history of the citadel. Through five uniquely designed lantern years, players guide these survivors through hunts against core game monsters, uncovering the secrets of their order and ultimately learning Cain's fate—a conclusion that, given the nature of Kingdom Death, is unlikely to offer comfort.

## Lore Significance

Cain's existence speaks to the hierarchical remnants of the Black Knight order—once great, now reduced to ruins and a handful of servants maintaining rituals whose meanings may have long since decayed. The squires represent a form of structured survival rarely seen in the Kingdom Death setting, where most humans exist in desperate, formless settlements. That such an order persists, complete with defined roles like "vanguard," hints at knowledge and traditions preserved from an earlier, perhaps nobler age.

The biblical resonance of Cain's name—the first murderer, marked and cast out—may be coincidental or deeply intentional. In Kingdom Death's world of cyclical violence and inherited sin, bearing such a name while serving as protector rather than aggressor creates a tension worth noting. *[Speculation: Whether Cain's name reflects his nature, his past, or his eventual fate remains to be discovered through play.]*
