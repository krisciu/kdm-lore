# Scouts of Death

> *"Recovering gear from a disastrous battle is no longer a guarantee."*

**Category:** Character
**Type:** Survivor Role
**Expansion:** Gambler's Chest

---

## Overview

The Scouts of Death represent a specialized role within survivor hunting parties—silent watchers who travel alongside their companions yet remain apart from the main hunt. These individuals serve a grim but essential purpose: they are the settlement's insurance against catastrophe, and their presence fundamentally changes the stakes of every expedition into the darkness.

Introduced as part of the Scout System in the Gambler's Chest expansion, these characters add a new layer of difficulty to campaigns. Where once survivors could rely on the eventual recovery of fallen comrades' equipment, the scouts introduce uncertainty into even the aftermath of disaster. Their dual nature—part guardian, part scavenger—reflects the brutal pragmatism required to survive in a world where every resource is precious and every death must serve some purpose.

## Role and Function

The scout travels beside the hunting party but maintains a critical distance. Their primary responsibility is not to fight alongside their companions, but to ensure the hunters do not inadvertently lead monsters back to the settlement. In a world where settlements cling to existence like dying embers, this protective duty cannot be overstated.

When battle goes poorly and survivors fall, the scout's role shifts to salvage. They will attempt to recover what they can from their fallen companions—though success is never guaranteed. The darkness is hungry, and what the monsters leave behind may not always be retrievable. This mechanic fundamentally alters the safety net that players might rely upon, making each hunt carry weightier consequences.

Should the hunting party prove victorious, the scout's vigilant observation serves another purpose entirely. Watching from their careful distance, they may glean useful information about the monster's behaviors and weaknesses—knowledge that could prove invaluable in future battles.

## The Weight of Witness

*[Speculative interpretation based on themes]*

There is a particular loneliness to the scout's existence. They witness their companions fight, bleed, and sometimes die, yet they cannot—must not—intervene directly. Their duty demands restraint when every instinct might scream to help. They are the last eyes to see their friends alive, and often the first to sift through what remains.

The settlement trusts them with an impossible burden: to watch, to wait, and to bring back whatever survives the encounter—whether that be triumphant hunters carrying trophies, or simply the weapons pried from cooling hands.

## Lore Significance

The Scouts of Death embody one of Kingdom Death's central themes: survival demands sacrifice, and sometimes that sacrifice is not death but the burden of living with difficult choices. They represent the settlement's acknowledgment that not every hunter will return, and that pragmatic measures must exist to preserve what little humanity has managed to create.

Their existence also speaks to the sophisticated understanding settlements must develop about the dangers they face. Monsters do not merely threaten hunters in the wild—they threaten everything if led back to vulnerable populations. The scouts stand as the thin line between a failed hunt and total annihilation.
