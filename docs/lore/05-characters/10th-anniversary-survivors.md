# 10th Anniversary Survivors

One extinguishing lantern after another, the grizzled foursome persevered. The insight gleaned from their life in the darkness has ignited a spark of ingenuity.
In celebration of 10 years since the release of the first Kingdom Death figure, we revisit the starting survivors of Monster, Allister, Zachary, Lucy, and Erza. A lantern decade into their survival, these reimagined figures show the ingenuity and grit required to endure the darkness.
The 10th Anniversary Survivor figures are accompanied by Seed Patterns for Kingdom Death: Monster. A Seed Pattern represents a spark of crafting inspiration that accompanies insight gleaned about the world. When survivors reach their insights, draw a Pattern. It will describe what to use and how to craft a brand new piece of gear. When these crafting elements are assembled a new idea takes physical form.
