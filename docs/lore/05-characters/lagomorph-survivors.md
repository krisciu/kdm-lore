# Lagomorph Survivors

Encore Edition: Limit 2 per customer
The survivors live under a canopy of glistening tendrils that disappear into an infinite horizon they cannot reach, no matter how long they journey. When they are disturbed, the quivering tendrils fill rapidly with twisting obstructions that burst forth from the engorged threads. Commonly, fleshy lagomorph creatures emerge shrieking, attacking the settlement. In the undisturbed silence, the survivors hear the tendrils singing in their language.
The First Run Collector's Edition is enclosed in a hand stamped kraft box, limited to 500 and includes:
Photoresin Lagomorph survivors
2x Hard Plastic Kingdom Death 30mm round insert and base
2x Large Matte Art Prints
2x Character Art Cards
