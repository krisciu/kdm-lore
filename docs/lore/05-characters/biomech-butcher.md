# Biomech Butcher

In celebration of an energizing Gen Con, we're offering the Biomech Butcher for a limited time to those who couldn't make the show.
It awoke in the hulk of a derelict craft, trapped in the last remaining intact life-support pod. The Biomech Butcher spent maddening eons scavenging the darkness to yoke its atrophied husk to a new form. Countless moments with nothing but festering thoughts of abandonment and vengeance to twist its mind.
