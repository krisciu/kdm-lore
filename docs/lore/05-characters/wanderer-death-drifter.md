# Wanderer - Death Drifter

Wanderers are new to Kingdom Death: Monster with the release of the Gambler's Chest expansion. Any campaign can now add a wanderer, a mysterious stranger that makes your settlement their temporary home.
As they fight alongside your settlement, their own story unfolds. Secrets, skills, and more are shared by your visitor. Cultivate a relationship as the wanderer fights along with your survivors to protect your settlement. When they leave, as they all inevitably do, they will leave an indelible mark of their life on your campaign.
Wanderer Death Drifter arrives with a silent agenda. The settlement may attempt to unlock the mystery of his motivation.
Wanderer - Death Drifter is packaged in a uniquely designed graphical box and includes:
1 x Death Drifter hard plastic miniature
1 x Death Drifter scenic base insert
1 x Kingdom Death 30mm base
5 x Knowledge cards
1 x Fighting art card
5 x Arc survivor record sheets
1 x Divider
4 x Rare gear cards
1 x Glossary card
1 x Strain milestone card
