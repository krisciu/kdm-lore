# Aya the Survivor

> *"Her deadly weapons suggest a powerful quarry waiting for Aya at the end of her hunt."*

**Category:** Character
**Type:** Named Survivor
**Expansion:** Promotional/Collector Series (Vagabond Armor Set)

---

## Overview

Aya the Survivor is a solitary hunter whose journey is chronicled through a series of sculptural installations, each capturing a moment frozen in the endless darkness. Unlike the nameless masses who perish in obscurity, Aya's exploits have been deemed worthy of remembrance—a rare honor in a world where survival itself is measured in heartbeats rather than years.

Her story is one of pursuit and deterioration, told not through words but through the shifting state of her armor and the desperation etched into her posture across multiple depictions. Armed with weapons of terrible power, Aya hunts something beyond the capabilities of lesser survivors—a quarry so dangerous that even her formidable arsenal may prove insufficient.

## The Journey

### Before the Wall

The earliest documented moment of Aya's hunt finds her standing resolute, her purpose still intact and her spirit unbroken. She bears the **Black Sword**—a weapon of notorious reputation—and the **Beacon Shield**, tools that speak to both her prowess and the magnitude of her undertaking. Her **Vagabond Armor** is complete: the **Tabard** and **White Dragon Gauntlets** pristine, ready for the trials ahead.

This is Aya at the start of her journey, a survivor who has chosen to venture beyond the relative safety of settlement walls in pursuit of something. The nature of her quarry remains unknown, but the quality of her equipment suggests she knows exactly what awaits her—and has prepared accordingly.

### Beyond the Wall

What transpires between these moments remains shrouded in darkness, but the results are unmistakable. The second installation finds Aya transformed: battered, desperate, hiding behind convenient rubble from an **unseen foe**. Her **Hard Breastplate** and **Cloth Leggings** show the wear of conflict and flight.

The hunter has become the hunted. Whatever Aya pursued—or whatever found her—has reduced this formidable warrior to a fugitive, seeking cover where she can find it. The wall that once marked the boundary of her journey now serves as desperate shelter.

## Equipment

Aya wears the **Vagabond Armor** set, a collection of gear that bestows unique bonuses upon its wearer:

- **Tabard** - Part of the armor set worn during her initial journey
- **White Dragon Gauntlets** - Protective gear suggesting encounters with draconic entities
- **Hard Breastplate** - Core protection, visible in her later, more desperate state
- **Cloth Leggings** - Lighter leg protection allowing for mobility

Her weapons include:
- **Black Sword** - A blade of infamous power
- **Beacon Shield** - Defensive equipment, possibly serving purposes beyond mere protection

## Lore Significance

Aya represents a particular archetype within Kingdom Death: the lone hunter who ventures beyond the fragile sanctuaries of civilization in pursuit of specific prey. Her documented decline from confident warrior to desperate fugitive mirrors the broader truth of the Monster world—that hope is merely the first casualty, followed inevitably by everything else.

The existence of a sculptural series documenting her exploits suggests that her story held meaning to those who witnessed or remembered it. Whether she succeeded in her hunt, whether she survived beyond the wall, whether she ever returned—these questions remain unanswered, perhaps deliberately so.

*[Speculation: The "powerful quarry" hinted at in the sources is never identified. Given the quality of her equipment, particularly the White Dragon Gauntlets, she may have been pursuing something of draconic origin, or perhaps something even more terrible that required such specific armaments.]*
