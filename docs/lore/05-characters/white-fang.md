# White Fang

> *"In the darkness, teeth tell stories that tongues cannot speak."*

**Category:** Character
**Type:** Narrative Sculpture
**Expansion:** Gambler's Chest

## Overview

White Fang is a character miniature included in the Gambler's Chest expansion for Kingdom Death: Monster. Listed among the expansion's 46 Narrative Sculptures, White Fang represents one of the "Characters with enduring appeal" that the expansion's Character System allows players to create and develop throughout their campaigns.

As a Narrative Sculpture, White Fang exists as both a collectible miniature and a representation of a survivor whose story intertwines with the broader systems introduced in the Gambler's Chest—including the Philosophy System, Wanderer System, and the overarching Character System that gives certain survivors lasting significance across a settlement's desperate struggle for survival.

## Physical Description

*[Detailed physical description unavailable in current sources. The name "White Fang" suggests a survivor distinguished by pale coloration, prominent dental features, or perhaps gear crafted from bleached bone or monster teeth.]*

## Speculation on Identity

The evocative name "White Fang" places this character among Kingdom Death's tradition of survivors defined by their relationship to the monstrous—those who have taken something of the beasts they hunt into themselves. Whether this refers to actual physical transformation, distinctive weaponry, or a title earned through deeds of savage prowess remains unclear from available sources.

*[Note: The following is speculative based on naming conventions and Kingdom Death themes.]* The character may represent a survivor who has embraced a more primal path, perhaps connected to the game's themes of humanity's thin line between hunter and hunted.

## Lore Significance

As part of the Character System introduced in the Gambler's Chest, White Fang represents the expansion's focus on creating survivors with deeper narrative presence. Unlike standard survivors who may perish and be forgotten, Characters persist in memory and mechanical significance, their stories echoing through the settlement's history.
