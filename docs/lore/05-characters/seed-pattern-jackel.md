# Seed Pattern - Jackel

Once, Jackel was poised to strike the killing blow, when a brave survivor surged from behind, stealing her triumph. Frozen in thin-lipped silence, she could not offer even the most insincere accolades. A one-sided rivalry flourished in her embittered imagination. Never missing the chance to depart with her competitor in the hopes of glimpsing his bloody defeat. Finally, the seed of her bitterness bore fruit, the image of a rending weapon, one to leave her daring rival spineless.
