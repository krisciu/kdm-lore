# Iola

> *"Scurrying in the shadows of the citadel, dutybound..."*

**Category:** Character
**Type:** Squire
**Expansion:** Black Knight Expansion

---

## Overview

Iola is one of four squires bound to service within the crumbling sanctuary of the Black Knight, a feral guardian dwelling in a cliffside citadel upon an inverted mountain. Designated as the **Master Artisan** among her peers, Iola possesses skills in crafting and creation that set her apart from the other servants of the restless knight.

Her story unfolds across the Squires of the Citadel campaign—a harrowing five lantern year narrative that peels back the secretive existence of those who dwell in the Black Knight's shadow. While Cain stands as vanguard and Owen endures as the unbreakable, Iola's hands shape the remnants of the once-great Black Knight order's artifices.

## Role in the Citadel

As Master Artisan, Iola likely serves a crucial function within the citadel's hierarchy. The Black Knight order was once renowned for its great artifices—weapons, armor, and mysterious works of craftsmanship that speak to a grander age now fallen to ruin. Iola's designation suggests she maintains, preserves, or perhaps attempts to recreate these lost works while scurrying through the claustrophobic remains of her master's domain.

The title "Master" implies a level of expertise and seniority, potentially marking Iola as more experienced than some of her fellow squires, such as the "Novice" Elle. Yet mastery offers no guarantee of survival in Kingdom Death's brutal reality.

## The Squire's Existence

Life within the citadel is one of duty and secrecy. Iola and her fellow squires eke out their existence under the auspices of the Black Knight—a heavy-handed, rage-filled guardian whose domain sits precariously on the edge of oblivion. The inverted mountain offers no safety; one misstep sends the unwary careening into the void below, leaving no trace of their fall.

The squires' tale is one of survival against impossible circumstances, their fates intertwined with the mysteries of an order that has descended into feral chaos.

## Lore Significance

Iola represents the human element within the Black Knight's domain—a reminder that even monstrous entities require servants, and that those servants carry their own stories, skills, and desperate hopes. Her role as artisan connects to Kingdom Death's broader themes of craftsmanship and creation as survival mechanisms. In a world where humanity clings to existence through the weapons and tools forged from monster remains, a master artisan holds precious, perhaps irreplaceable knowledge.

The secrets she uncovers—or creates—may offer glimpses into what the Black Knight order once was before its fall into ruinous guardianship.
