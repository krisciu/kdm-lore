## Overview

The Screaming Hoarder is a character miniature included among the 46 Narrative Sculptures featured in the Gambler's Chest expansion. As part of this extensive collection of character models, the Screaming Hoarder represents one of the unique survivor archetypes or settlement denizens that players may encounter or create through their campaigns.

Narrative Sculptures in the Gambler's Chest serve to bring the stories and emergent narratives of Kingdom Death: Monster to life, representing the diverse fates, roles, and transformations that survivors undergo in their desperate struggle against the darkness. The Screaming Hoarder's evocative name suggests a character consumed by obsessive accumulation—whether of resources, relics, or perhaps more disturbing things.

## Physical Description

*[Speculative based on naming conventions]*

The name "Screaming Hoarder" implies a figure twisted by compulsion—likely depicted surrounded by or clutching accumulated possessions. In the Kingdom Death setting, such hoarding behavior might manifest from trauma, madness induced by the horrors of the darkness, or perhaps a desperate survival strategy taken to pathological extremes. The "screaming" element suggests this is not a quiet madness, but one that has broken the character's composure entirely.

## Lore Significance

*[Speculative]*

In settlements clinging to existence at the edge of oblivion, resources mean survival. Every scrap of monster hide, every shard of bone, every strange ore pulled from the darkness holds the potential for weapons, armor, or tools that might mean the difference between life and death. It is perhaps inevitable that some survivors, having witnessed the loss of everything, become fixated on accumulation—hoarding resources beyond reason, screaming at any who approach their precious piles.

Such individuals represent the psychological toll of life in the Kingdom Death universe, where even survival can become its own form of corruption. The Screaming Hoarder may serve as a cautionary tale within settlements—a reminder that madness takes many forms.
