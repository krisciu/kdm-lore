# Early Survivor - Zelda

Since Zelda found the gleaming dagger, she has been different. Swatting at non-existent buzzing and describing a tickle in her brain. While others aren't looking, she organizes mundane objects around the settlement into patterns, or simply vanishes for entire lantern years at a time. Her fellow survivors have urged her to ditch the well crafted weapon, but she staunchly refuses.
