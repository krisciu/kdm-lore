# Guinevere

Guinevere was born on the day of the lantern eclipse, as the darkness closed in on the settlement, her cries pierced the darkness. A warning to the lurking threats beyond.
In her youth they wondered if she was a coward. She demurred when the hunters gathered to depart. When the monsters appeared at the settlement's edge, she showed her mettle.
