# Generic Male Knight

The Knight is the result of a collaboration between Adam & Lokman, exploring some well established tropes in fantasy art. Originally intended as a small line of Generic Hero Classes, the results were so compelling and un-generic, each hero's appearance told so many exciting stories that we wanted to integrate them into the KD world but so far nothing concrete has emerged.
When the knight's weapon is first used, they are sundered from their attachments. The scorched air and burnt broken promises fertilize the ground, making this the only place where ardor arbors grow.
