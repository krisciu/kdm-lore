# Allister

> *"One extinguishing lantern after another, the grizzled foursome persevered."*

**Category:** Character  
**Type:** Starting Survivor  
**Expansion:** Core Game

---

## Overview

Allister stands among the first to rise from the darkness—one of four souls who opened their eyes beside the fallen corpse of a great beast and found themselves thrust into a nightmare of survival. As a starting survivor in Kingdom Death: Monster, Allister represents the fragile spark of humanity's will to persist against impossible odds. Armed with nothing but stone and desperation, these first survivors mark the beginning of every settlement's desperate chronicle.

The 10th Anniversary reimagining of Allister depicts a survivor transformed by a full lantern decade of endurance. Where once stood a naked, bewildered figure clutching crude weapons, now stands a grizzled veteran whose every scar tells a story of monsters slain, companions lost, and lessons carved into flesh and memory. This Allister embodies the ingenuity and grit required to endure the darkness—proof that humanity can not only survive but adapt and innovate even in the most hostile of existences.

## History

Allister's story begins as all survivor stories do—in confusion, terror, and blood. Emerging into consciousness beside the corpse of a great White Lion, surrounded by the faint glow of a lantern horde, Allister joined Zachary, Lucy, and Erza in humanity's eternal struggle against the darkness. These four represent the primordial moment of every settlement: that first desperate gasp of awareness in a world that offers no explanations and shows no mercy.

A lantern decade into survival, Allister has been transformed by the crucible of the darkness. The insight gleaned from countless hunts, showdowns, and the slow accumulation of hard-won knowledge has ignited within this survivor a spark of ingenuity. Where once survival meant simply not dying, it now means crafting, innovating, and pushing the boundaries of what humans can create from the flesh and bone of nightmares.

## Physical Description

*[Speculative based on product context]* The 10th Anniversary depiction of Allister shows the physical toll and triumph of prolonged survival. The "grizzled" nature of the veteran survivor suggests weathered features, accumulated scars, and the lean hardness that comes from years of hunting monsters in the darkness. The figure stands upon a unique scenic base, a silent monument to the ground they have claimed from the eternal night.

The craftsmanship of the miniature—sculpted by Team Death from concept art by Lokman Lam—captures both the weariness and determination of a decade-long survivor. Equipment and gear likely reflect the ingenuity mentioned in the source material, incorporating elements crafted through Seed Patterns and the accumulated wisdom of survival.

## Lore Significance

Allister holds profound significance within Kingdom Death's mythology as one of the foundational figures of human survival. The starting survivors represent the baseline of humanity—individuals with no inherited knowledge, no cultural memory, no understanding of the horrors that await them. Every settlement traces its lineage, in some spiritual sense, back to these first four.

The 10th Anniversary version elevates Allister's significance further, demonstrating that survival is possible, that the darkness can be endured, and that insight transforms not just individuals but the very nature of human ingenuity. The Seed Pattern system introduced alongside these figures represents this concept mechanically—knowledge hard-won through experience crystallizing into new forms of creation.

## Seed Patterns

The 10th Anniversary Allister is intrinsically connected to the Seed Pattern system. These patterns represent sparks of crafting inspiration that accompany the insight survivors glean about their world. When survivors reach moments of profound understanding, they may draw upon these patterns—instructions that describe what resources to gather and how to combine them into entirely new pieces of gear.

This system reflects Allister's journey from naked desperation to grizzled ingenuity. The patterns are not merely recipes but revelations, moments where the accumulated horror and wonder of existence in the darkness coalesce into something useful, something that might mean the difference between death and another lantern year of survival.
