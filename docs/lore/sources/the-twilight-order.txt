Twilight Knight
The Twilight Knights order once protected the recorded knowledge of humanity in Kingdom Death.
Now in shambles, the Twilight Knights, with their archivists, struggle to keep the tiny flame of
knowledge alive.
Initiates to the Twilight Knight order are permanently altered to protect their minds from the horrors
they use face in their quest. Detached and unfeeling, they are prepared to pay any cost to salvage and
protect the valuable records of wisdom that remain in the world.
Twilight Order Knight
The Order Knight is a paragon of the Twilight Order. Surviving countless battle with the darkness and
within himself, he has powerful control over the relics and the blank slate of his mind remains sound.
He bears the most treasured gear of the order.
The Twilight Knights once protected the recorded knowledge of humanity in Kingdom Death. Now in
shambles, the knights, with their partner archivists, struggle to keep the tiny flame of knowledge alive.

Twilight Relic Knight
The Relic Knight has lost control to the personality living inside his relic sword. The relic sword has no
consideration for the lost knight's body. He sheds his bulky, restrictive armor, choosing light simple
clothes to keep his movement fast and unrestricted. He fights with furious disregard for his corporeal
wellbeing, pushing his muscles to the absolute limits.

Archivist
Stories lament the fall of the Grand Library in hushed tones. The surviving archivists and their sworn
knights fled clutching precious armfuls, all that remains of the knowledge assembled by humanity.
Today the Twilight Order is scattered, working in isolated pairs to do and record what little good they
can.
Deserter
The Deserter Knight has experienced trauma so horrible that it destroys the Twilight Order's mind
locks that remove the memories and personality of initiates. Suddenly faced with their humanity and
unprotected from the horrors they face the Deserter will o�en flee. Without the careful aid of an
Archivist, the Deserter loses control of the relic hood and sword which torture the Deserter. In order to
continue wielding the relics, Deserters will o�en turn their hoods into tattered bandages and chain
their swords to their bodies.
