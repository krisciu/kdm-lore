BLACKOUT
All at once and without warning, the collected sum of the settlement's lanterns go black.
The settlement is plunged into darkness.
Congratulations & Thanks for Playing!
You have completed the Kingdom Death: Monster core campaign. Without the lantern light and the
Watcher 's powerful presence, monsters descend without end to devour the settlement.
There is no hope for the survivors. However, if you like, you can continue to the bitter end and die
magnificent deaths. The settlement gains the Exhausted Lantern Hoard location. It has the rules
for continuing the campaign until its ultimate demise. Good luck!
