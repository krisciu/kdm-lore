MONSTERS

Monsters have unique anatomies and behaviors. The 
bizarre, inscrutable intelligence of monsters is repre-
sented in the game by these unique components:

- Miniatures that physically represent the monster.
- Story events that define a monster’s attributes.
- Unique AI decks that control the monster’s actions.
- Hit location decks that describe the parts of mon-
sters that survivors can attack.
- Monster resources gained from defeating monsters.
- Hunt events that occur while hunting the monster.

Monster Miniatures

Miniatures are included to represent all 7 monsters 
that players will face. Some monsters have many 
parts and can be very large (like the Phoenix). 
    Only the White Lion miniature is needed to 
begin the game. Players don’t need to assemble a 
monster’s miniature until they are ready to fight it.
    As you progress through the campaign, take the 
time to build new monsters as a part of the hobby 
aspect of Monster.
    Monster miniatures are attached to 50 mm bases 
(White Lion, Screaming Antelope, Butcher, King’s Man, 
The Hand, Watcher) or 100 mm bases (Phoenix).        2 | Instinct                                         4 | Monster Characteristics & Attributes

The Hunt Phase

During the Hunt Phase, players will: 
 - Choose a quarry
 - Set up the hunt board
 - Hunt the quarry along the hunt board until a show-
  down begins or the hunt fails.

Place the hunt board (the opposite side of the settle-
ment board) on the table. Place the gear grids, and 
record sheets of the survivors that compose the hunt 
team on the table.

100 | The Finale

An enormous, metallic sound rings out from a distance. 
All survivors are electrified with dread; they suffer 2 brain 
event damage.
      The survivors may follow the sound. Otherwise, they 
panic and retreat in the opposite direction; end this event 
and move the survivors 2 spaces back on the hunt board.
      Each survivor gains +1 courage and gingerly ap-
proaches the sound’s origin. As they travel, they pass the 
shattered corpses of strange beasts. 
      If any survivor has 3+ understanding, they follow the 
trail of corpses. Otherwise, harvest 3 random basic re-
sources from the corpses and end this event.
      Arriving at a massive anvil, the survivors see a giant, 
one-eyed knight, its charcoal-colored armor reflecting their 
lantern light. The event revealer rolls 1d10.

         less than 3 courage are struck dead. All other survi-
         vors flee in horror.
 2 - 8   The knight approaches the survivors. In an instant, 
         it chops off a random survivor's ear; they gain 1 
         bleeding token. Then, it strikes the anvil, blinding 
         the survivors with a churning wall of sound. When 
         they open their eyes, the knight is gone and the Steel 
         Sword and Steel Shield rare gear rest in its place. The 
         group divides the gear between them.
 9 +     The knight smashes the object in its hands upon the 
         anvil. When the molten orange object cools, it sets 
         into a massive lion-faced hammer. The knight places it 
         in the hands of the survivor with the highest courage 
         (roll off in case of ties). They gain the Thunder Maul 
         rare gear. A current of electricity runs through their 
         body, joining weapon and survivor forever.
