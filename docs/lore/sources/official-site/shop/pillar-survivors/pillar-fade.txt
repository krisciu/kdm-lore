## Description

Fade violated the White Speakers' oath against childbearing. Expecting no mercy, she fled the cult with her child and the Sword of Silence stolen from the Sword Hunters' armory.

## Pillar Cards

Pillar cards are used during the design of your new campaign. They add rules that increase the depth of your campaign experience. Campaigns of Death Vol 1 (CoD) includes complete rules for campaign design that includes pillar cards.

### Using Fade in Your Campaign

When you design your next campaign, if you want to include this pillar, add the listed campaign milestone:

**When the settlement innovates Storytelling | Replace a basic hunt event with Baby and the Sword**

Add this with other Milestone Story Events on your settlement record sheet.

## Lore Details

### Fade's Story
- Former member of the White Speakers cult
- Violated their sacred oath against childbearing
- Became pregnant and had a child despite the prohibition
- Expected no mercy from the cult for her transgression
- Fled the cult, taking her child with her
- Stole the Sword of Silence from the Sword Hunters' armory during her escape

### White Speakers Connection
This confirms important lore about the White Speakers:
- They have an oath/prohibition against childbearing
- The punishment for violation is severe enough that Fade expected no mercy
- They are connected to or associated with the Sword Hunters
- The Sword Hunters have an armory with special weapons like the Sword of Silence

### The Sword of Silence
A rare gear item that Fade stole from the Sword Hunters. The name suggests it may have stealth or silencing properties.

### Newborn
Fade's child is represented as a rare gear card called "Newborn" - suggesting the baby can somehow be used mechanically in the game, perhaps as a resource or companion.

## Key Lore Points

- White Speakers have strict prohibition against childbearing
- Sword Hunters are a faction with an armory
- The Sword of Silence exists as a special weapon
- A mother's love can overcome cult loyalty
- Children/babies exist as game elements in KDM
