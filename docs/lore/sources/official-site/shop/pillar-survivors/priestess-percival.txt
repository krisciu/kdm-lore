## Lore Notes

### Percival's Journey
- Started as a "young" and "unrefined prodigy"
- Traveled to a "land bathed in sun" - likely the Sunstalker territory
- Trained in sword arts, developing a unique style
- Eventually returned to the "citadel in the sky" - suggests origin from a high/elevated settlement

### The Citadel in the Sky
- Percival's origin location
- A citadel (fortified structure) located in the sky
- Could be related to:
  - The People of the Stars
  - A floating settlement
  - A mountain-top fortress

### People of the Sun Connection
- This release ties Percival to the People of the Sun faction
- People of the Sun likely inhabit the sun-bathed lands
- May be connected to Sunstalker lore

### New Gear Introduced
- **Syncretic Vestments**: Pattern gear (vestments = religious garments)
- **Sanctuary Longsword**: Rare gear with defensive/protective theme
- **Sun Sparring Rite**: Settlement event for training

### "Syncretic" Meaning
- Syncretism = blending of different religious/philosophical beliefs
- Suggests Percival combined different fighting traditions
- Her "new style" may merge multiple schools of combat
