## Description

Percival was a member of a small order called the Black Knights. The Black Knights were founded by a militaristic settlement that hoped to conquer the darkness and provide a safe haven for all. A great crusade called the Black Knights into action and Percival left her home, never to be seen again.

Before leaving, though, she commanded her loyal companion, a young puppy, to wait for her safe return. It still waits to this day.

- Female knight (she/her)
- Left home on a great crusade

### The Black Knights
A newly revealed faction in KDM lore:

- Their mission: "to conquer the darkness and provide a safe haven for all"
- Went on a "great crusade"
- The fate of the order is unknown but implied to be tragic (Percival "never to be seen again")

### Arthurian Connections
The name "Percival" is from Arthurian legend:
- Sir Percival was a Knight of the Round Table
- Famous for his involvement in the Holy Grail quest
- The Black Knights also echo medieval knight orders
- This connects to other Arthurian-named KDM characters like Guinevere

### The Waiting Puppy
One of the most poignant details:
- Percival left her puppy behind with orders to wait
- The puppy still waits "to this day"
- Suggests this is a story of loss and eternal hope
- The puppy represents loyalty and the tragedy of those left behind
