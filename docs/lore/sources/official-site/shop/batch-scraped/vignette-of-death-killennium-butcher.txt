## Description

Vignettes of Death are a great diversion from the intensity of Monster campaigns or an easy way to introduce new players, dipping their toes into the fathomless ocean of Kingdom Death: Monster.
Play as four wish seekers pursuing the Killennium Butcher to steal a wish granted by the frozen star. The awakened monster will not give up its boon easily, attacking the survivors with an intensity of rage that freezes the very air. The new larger-sized vignette rules reveal branching outcomes of your showdown determined by who's left standing when the snow clears.
Using ready-to-play gear grids, survivor vignette cards, and limited components from your Monster core game makes the vignette a quick way to dive into a brand new story.
