## Description

Arc survivors use philosophies. For best experience, use with the Gambler's Chest expansion.
Life blooms in the harshest corners of the darkness. Pale shoots and lurid blossoms persevere. They inspire arc survivors to focus on the plants that inhabit their world. 
Philosophies of Death - Gatherism introduces a new worldview that can be integrated into any arc survivor campaign, offering a cascade of botanical reverberations that will drastically alter the ecology of your game.
Gatherism is a Tier 2 Philosophy. Settlements must reach new levels of sophistication and unlock them using collective cognition.
