## Description

Crafted from tanned hides and lantern scraps, leather armor is tough and light. Most importantly it reduces impacts and helps bring out a survivors masochistic side.
Packaged in a humble ziplock bag, includes:

1x Leather Armor Kit Sprue (makes 4 miniatures)
4x Plastic Bases and Inserts


*Naked products do not include packaging or any artwork, it is simply the miniature in its most 'naked' state!
*We have decided to extend the Naked Armor kit offerings for the time being. At its core, Monster is a hobby game and we are glad that we can bring more options to how people enjoy their miniatures and campaigns.
