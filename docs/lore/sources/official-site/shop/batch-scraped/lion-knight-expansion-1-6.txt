## Description

Incapable of emotion, the Lion Knight seeks to understand the world around it through its bizarre, self-serving stage productions. Between performances, it is a distant husk, unaffected by the normal world. When the time comes, "actors" are gathered by the Lion Knight's masked retinue to join it onstage. There, it hopes to capture and vicariously experience their excitement, fears, and ultimately, their deaths. However, it remains up to the survivors to decide whether or not they stick to their scripts.
The Lion Knight [NN2] is a node 2 nemesis monster, it tests the mettle of settlements further along in their campaign. This expansion replaces the King's Man in Kingdom Death: Monster campaigns. It includes:

Lion Knight sprues (includes survivor gear and the Lion Knight Monster)
