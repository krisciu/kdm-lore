## Description

Warped for untold lantern years by the tormenting whispers of an evil parasite, the last great ruler of the Silver City would be unrecognizable to their subjects if any were alive to see them today. Lacking the faintest glimmer of its former glory, the Lion God stalks the dead streets of its once-bustling kingdom in a mindless rage. Anything that comes within reach of its filthy, petrified claws is eaten or destroyed. 




Use the maze-like terrain to your advantage, as the Lion God is fearsome and difficult to engage directly. If you manage to survive one of its brutal attacks, it might be wiser to play dead than to expose yourself to another attack.
The Lion God is a node 4 quarry monster, a magnificent challenge for the most ambitious settlements late in their campaign.  This expansion replaces nothing, no such level of challenge exists in the core Kingdom Death: Monster campaigns. It includes:

Lion God sprues (includes survivor gear and the Lion God Monster)
9x Gear cards
32x Lion God AI cards
20x Lion God HL cards
5x Strange Resource cards
8x Lion God Hunt Events cards
2x Terrain cards
5x Terrain tiles
4x Disorder cards
4x Fighting Art cards
1x Secret Fighting Art card
1x Innovation card
2x Lion God card dividers
