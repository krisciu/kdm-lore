## Lore Notes

### Grimmory's Affliction
- Suffers from "blighted vision" - damaged/corrupted sight
- Sees a "bleached field of painful light" - constant blinding brightness
- "Shadows moving across his aching retinas" - hallucinatory or damaged perception
- Seeks a "remedy" - actively hunting for a cure
- Hunts a "beast that might restore a time before" - implies the creature could reverse his condition

### Character Analysis
- Name "Grimmory" suggests "grim" + possibly "grimoire" (spell book)
- "Woe" prefix indicates suffering/misery
- Japanese weapon names (Hachigane, Kusarigama) suggest Eastern influence
- May have been blinded by exposure to light-based entity (Phoenix? Sunstalker?)

### Gear & Mechanics
- **Woe Hachigane**: A type of Japanese forehead protector/helmet
- **Woe Kusarigama**: Chain-sickle weapon (Japanese farming tool turned weapon)
- **Clobber**: Attack-related keyword
- **Flinch**: Defensive/reaction keyword  
- **Foresight**: Prediction/anticipation keyword (ironic given his vision problems)
