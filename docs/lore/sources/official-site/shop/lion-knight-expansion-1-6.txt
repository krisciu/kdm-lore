## Lion Knight Lore

Incapable of emotion, the Lion Knight seeks to understand the world around it through its bizarre, self-serving stage productions. Between performances, it is a distant husk, unaffected by the normal world. When the time comes, "actors" are gathered by the Lion Knight's masked retinue to join it onstage. There, it hopes to capture and vicariously experience their excitement, fears, and ultimately, their deaths. However, it remains up to the survivors to decide whether or not they stick to their scripts.
