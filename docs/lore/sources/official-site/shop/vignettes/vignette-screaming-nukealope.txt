## Overview

Vignettes of Death are a great diversion from the intensity of Monster campaigns or an easy way to introduce new players, dipping their toes into the fathomless ocean of Kingdom Death: Monster.

## The Story

### Critical Meltdown
A twisted monster blazing with radioactive power. An oddly chummy bunch.

A riotous comic introduces the story of Team Gnostin as they reach another reset of their perpetual suffering. Over 20 pages of vivid illustrations.

### Team Gnostin's Story
A squabbling, unlikely alliance rallies around Gnostin, determined to stop a destructive new quarry or die trying. Transfigured by radiation, the Screaming Nukealope's existence is constant pain for itself and its would-be hunters alike.

Embody the wits and teamwork of Gnostin's close knit company to achieve his envisioned perfect ending.

### Bonds Beyond Time
Discover an unlikely team of survivors, **inexplicably and interminably fated to face an inescapable explosion**.

This suggests the team is caught in some kind of time loop or repeating fate, facing the same explosive end repeatedly.
