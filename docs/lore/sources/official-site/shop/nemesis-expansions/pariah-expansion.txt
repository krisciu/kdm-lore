## Pariah Overview

The Pariah is an unconventional nemesis monster for Kingdom Death: Monster. Stunning and dramatic components accompany this unique monster.

Consumed by bitterness, the Pariah longs for the embrace of every settlement it visits. Those that accept it will suffer the monster's cruel caprices until they drive it out.

## Game Information

Pariah [NN1] is a node 1 nemesis monster, it arrives to challenge burgeoning settlements. This expansion replaces the Butcher in Kingdom Death: Monster campaigns.

A settlement infested by the Pariah's influence will grow to mirror its twisted image.

## Pariah Two Ways

### The Monster That Came to Stay

The Pariah arrives with false promises and tainted gifts.

Once the trap of sympathy is sprung, it feasts on their generosity. Forcing the settlement into sadistic games and gleefully laughing at their pain until the settlement revolts.

Previous nemesis monsters have arrived with bluster and violence to challenge the settlement's existence during critical points in their story. The Pariah makes itself at home in the settlement, inflicting lantern years of torture on the survivors trapped by their own compassion.

Features:
- Experience 2 torturous recurring settlement events
- Receive gifts of pattern gear with sinister ingredients

### Somatic Empathy - The Showdown

Your exploited settlement will resist the monster's fiendish games. With its hooks in your settlement's empathic impulses, the monster protects itself against your aggression by sharing its pain and frustration with the survivors that challenge it.

When survivors resolve to rid themselves of the parasitic Pariah, they find its hooks are deep in their hearts.

A showdown with the sadistic Pariah is twice as dangerous. The indignant monster attacks with its nimble limbs. Bound by the monster's sympathetic blood magic, the survivors also suffer when they harm the monster.

- Even the monster's unplayed AI cards contain new sources of danger.
- A crippling connection fortifies survivors with twisted understanding.

### Inverted Rage - The Upside-Down Showdown

When the monster is driven off, it will sink its spiteful claws even deeper. Leaving the settlement in perpetual suffering, they are forced to pursue the spiteful creature. The monster awaits them dangerously out of reach on the ceiling of a deadly, jagged landscape. The survivors must climb, hang, swing, and fly to meet the monster in a perspective-breaking upside-down showdown.

If the settlement drives the monster from their midst, the vindictive Pariah will disappear leaving its ruinous bond with the settlement intact. The settlement must set off into the darkness to find the spurned creature and sever their connection once and for all.

They find the Pariah sulking above their heads. They must scale the walls, swing, hang, and scramble to reach the monster effortlessly cavorting overhead.

A high stakes, inverted showdown transforms the monster and your strategy, leaving you clinging to life.

- Relying on handholds, strength, and agility, the survivors hang from the ceiling, desperately reaching for the unimpeded monster.
- Monster hit locations transform into inverted outcomes.

## Dark Influence

The Pariah remains skulking in the shadows. Grumbling and hissing, it shares its stolen dark secrets. It's twisted bitter rants poison the ordinary development of the settlement.

Survivors reaching deeper understanding of their world trigger visits from White Speaker storytellers. Should they set foot in a settlement occupied by the Pariah, they fall victim to the monster's vicious rage. Amassing a pile of cultist corpses will raise brows should the settlement also face the Red Witches.

Warped by the Pariah's bitter perspective the monster's presence in the settlement will replace your survivors' understanding milestones with new stories, abilities, and revelations.

- Replace White Secret core game story event with the Pariah's Dark Secret
- Settlements that innovate storytelling have new outcomes when the White Speaker visits.

## Pariah and White Speaker Cult

Rejected in shame, the Pariah harbors bottomless resentment against the White Speaker cult that gave birth to it.

This expansion interacts with the ubiquitous presence of White Speakers both in the core game:
- Understanding milestones formerly guided by the White Speakers are transformed in new story events told from the Pariah's perspective.
- Settlements that innovate storytelling often receive visits from White Speakers, with the Pariah lurking, their fate is changed in a new story event.
- The Pariah gifts the settlement questionable patterns for gear created by corrupted blood magic.

### Red Witches Interaction
Volatile interactions will occur if your campaign also includes the Red Witches, a squad of cultists tasked with hunting the erstwhile Pariah.
- The Pariah's violence against the White Speakers is not welcome news for the merciless squad.
- Innocently proffered gifts are revealed to be unforgiveable offenses.
- If the Pariah's influence over your settlement is discovered, you may find yourself at a potentially transformative crossroads for your campaign.
