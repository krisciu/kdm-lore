## Black Knight Lore

At the tolling of the strange bell, the settlement feels the inescapable call to face the feral guardian that awaits in the cliffside sanctuary.

A chaotic, ruinous battle ensues in the claustrophobic remains of the Black Knight's citadel. Stand your ground against the rage of the heavy-handed Black Knight or scramble to survive as you careen off the edge of the inverted mountain.

Victory will give you a glimpse into the once-great artifices of the Black Knight order. Defeat will leave no trace of your ill-fated fall.

## Game Information

The Black Knight is a node 3 nemesis monster and takes the place of the Hand in your core game campaign.

A settlement menaced by the Black Knight nemesis will face new settlement events, story events, and a unique ascent to face the Black Knight in its domain.

## The Citadel

The citadel is a crumbling maze of dangers. Wheeling chaos awaits the challengers.

16 lavishly illustrated citadel showdown tiles create a unique citadel for each showdown. Reveal its dangers as you crash and creep through the unfolding labyrinth, leaving heaps of rubble behind.

### Terminal Momentum
The citadel is packed with noble sculptures enthusiastically repaired by the hidden squires. The monster exploits their elastic structure to expel intruders from its domain.

Terrain tiles of artifacts and rubble transform the showdown as you careen through the delicate remains of a once-great order.

### Falling Peril
The guardian deftly navigates the crumbling ruins while its foes careen, bounce, and plummet from its depths.

No safety awaits at the citadel's edge, only the whistling chill of shearing wind and nothingness below.

### Sanctuary Secrets
While the guardian hounds your steps, explore the citadel for fresh advantages. Exploit the squire's adaptations for your own gain.

Each citadel configuration will present new combinations of obstacles and advantages.

## The Black Knight Order

The lost artifice of the Black Knights slumbers in dust and cobwebs. Ransack the ruins to escape with the ancient order's gifts.

Discoveries with lasting utility: 11 rare gear, 15 pattern gear, armor set bonuses, fighting arts, and more.

## Squires of the Citadel Campaign (5 Lantern Years)

This expansion includes a 5 lantern year campaign exploring the secretive life of the squires that scurry in the shadows of the citadel. Play five custom lantern years to unlock the secrets of the Black Knight order.

### The Four Squires

**Cain** - Stalwart vanguard
**Iola** - Master artisan
**Elle** - Novice acolyte
**Owen** - Unbreakable

### Campaign Overview
Squires care for the citadel's guardian, preserve the traditions of the Black Knight order, and maintain their noble home.

Despite the best days of the order dwindling behind them, four squires of the citadel struggle to uphold their duty. Suspicion poisons their fellowship. Variant monsters stand in their way.

The squire's story is told through 5 unique lantern years. Each lantern year contains a custom settlement, hunt, and showdown experiences crafted for the campaign.
