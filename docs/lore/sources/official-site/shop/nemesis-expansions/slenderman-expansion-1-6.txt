## Slenderman Lore

The Slenderman is a dark, cold hole in the memories of the few that have seen it and lived. Within this chilling gap of recollection, terror thrives, growing into panic and jumbled tales of warning. Facing the Slenderman tests the teamwork and sanity of the survivors that face it. The monster's movements are unpredictable, and it will often vanish from the board, leaving the team to carefully coordinate their actions to bring down their foe.

Slenderman's rewards are as alien as the monster itself. Strange substances from the Slenderman's domain will need careful research before they're put to use.
