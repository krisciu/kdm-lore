## Dung Beetle Knight Lore

Resourceful and hungry, this cunning species has evolved a knight's shape to fool both predators and prey. It rolls a massive resin ball formed from spit used to collect rare feces for its meals.

## Gameplay Overview

The Dung Beetle Knight is an extremely difficult foe. You will find that a little preparation goes a long way. The **Rumbling in the Dark** innovation will offer your settlement the opportunity to train before they face the Dung Beetle Knight. This is an opportunity that should not be missed.

## Game Information

The Dung Beetle Knight is a node 4 quarry monster, a magnificent challenge for the most ambitious settlements late in their campaign. This expansion replaces nothing, no such level of challenge exists in the core Kingdom Death: Monster campaigns.
