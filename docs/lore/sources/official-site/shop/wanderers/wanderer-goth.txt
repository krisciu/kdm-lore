## Description

Wanderers are new to Kingdom Death: Monster with the release of the Gambler's Chest expansion. Any campaign can now add a wanderer, a mysterious stranger that makes your settlement their temporary home.

As they fight alongside your settlement, their own story unfolds. Secrets, skills, and more are shared by your visitor. Cultivate a relationship as the wanderer fights along with your survivors to protect your settlement. When they leave, as they all inevitably do, they will leave an indelible mark of their life on your campaign.

## Goth's Story

Arriving in the settlement, an ailing Goth shares her story with the settlement before it's too late.

Goth arrives in a waking nightmare. In her aching heart, she knows her lanterns are limited. Fighting alongside the settlement, Goth struggles to accept the inevitable.

She is armed with a cunning, unfamiliar blade well suited for fighting the demons that seem to appear wherever she goes.

Will the settlement aid in Goth's race against time? What mark will she leave when her story ends?

## Mechanics

### Time-Limited Presence
Goth's narrative centers on mortality - she knows "her lanterns are limited" (a euphemism for her remaining lifespan in the KDM world). This suggests she may have unique mechanics around death, time limits, or urgency.

### Demon Attractor
Goth mentions that "demons seem to appear wherever she goes" - suggesting she may bring additional challenges or encounters to hunts.
