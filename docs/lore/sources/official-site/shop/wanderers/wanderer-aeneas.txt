## Description

Wanderers are new to Kingdom Death: Monster with the release of the Gambler's Chest expansion. Any campaign can now add a wanderer, a mysterious stranger that makes your settlement their temporary home.

As they fight alongside your settlement, their own story unfolds. Secrets, skills, and more are shared by your visitor. Cultivate a relationship as the wanderer fights along with your survivors to protect your settlement. When they leave, as they all inevitably do, they will leave an indelible mark of their life on your campaign.

## Aeneas's Story

**Arrival: Lantern Year 7**

Wanderer Aeneas arrives looking for a snack but stays to tell her story at the dinner table.

Aeneas arrives with an appetite for life. Share a meal and share her story. Aeneas will teach the settlement to savor life in new ways.

She carries the relics of her past and reveals her story as long as there's an extra portion waiting for her at the table.

A satiated Aeneas is a boon for the settlement's hunting party but a hangry Aeneas can be a curse.

## Mechanics

### Dual Modes
Aeneas has a unique mechanic with a Dual Modes tile, suggesting she can switch between different states (likely satiated vs hungry, based on her description).

### Indomitable Resources
Aeneas introduces 3 Indomitable resource cards - a special resource type.
