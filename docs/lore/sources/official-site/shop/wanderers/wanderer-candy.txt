## Description

Wanderers are new to Kingdom Death: Monster with the release of the Gambler's Chest expansion. Any campaign can now add a wanderer, a mysterious stranger that makes your settlement their temporary home.

As they fight alongside your settlement, their own story unfolds. Secrets, skills, and more are shared by your visitor. Cultivate a relationship as the wanderer fights along with your survivors to protect your settlement. When they leave, as they all inevitably do, they will leave an indelible mark of their life on your campaign.

## Candy's Story

**Arrival: Lantern Year 2**

Wanderer Candy escaped a deathmatch arena crumbling in flames. When she arrives, choking in smoke, she discovers that memories of a distant past weave a melancholy tale of longing for a brighter world.

Candy arrives early in your settlement's story. With a harrowing tale, she yearns for the bonds of friendship that she lost.

Candy arrives wearing rare gear that represents her journey.

Memories of her past unlock the power of fizzy bubbles. With her guidance the settlement may innovate a soda fountain that creates wondrous rare gear for the settlement.

## Wanderer Mechanics

### About Wanderers
Wanderers emerge from the darkness with a story to tell. For a time, they will call your settlement home.

A wanderer brings the artifacts of their previous life: new gear, disorders, fighting arts, and more. While they live in your settlement, they can use these to hunt and fight alongside the survivors.

Campaigns can have only one wanderer. Even after they leave the settlement or die, another will not appear.

### A Stranger Emerges
Each wanderers rulebook will specify a lantern year for their arrival. When you reach this, read their introduction story event and create their survivor record sheet.

### Disposition
Disposition is a wanderer attribute, it represents a wanderer's feelings towards their adopted settlement. It can increase or decrease during the campaign and can be negative. Keep track of a wanderer's disposition on their survivor record sheet. A Wanderer's disposition greatly influences the results of their story!

### Journey's End?
When a wanderer ponders the final level of their unique philosophy they will reach a crossroads. Their disposition and your choices will determine how their story ends. Will they disappear back into the gloom? What kind of enduring legacy will they entrust on your settlement?

## Arc Survivors

Arc survivors are a divergent strain of survivors introduced in the Gambler's Chest expansion. Their unique brain physiology enables the development of philosophies, a worldview that shapes them over time. Philosophies give rise to knowledges, skills that they can share with other arc survivors.

The story of a wanderer is told through their philosophy, and it unfolds while they live among your settlement's survivors. Wanderers ponder their story when they return from a battle, revealing more of their story as they fight alongside the settlement. Wanderers philosophies are unique to their survivor and cannot be adopted by other arc survivors.

However, if you are playing a campaign with arc survivors, wanderers will share their knowledge at your settlement's forum.
