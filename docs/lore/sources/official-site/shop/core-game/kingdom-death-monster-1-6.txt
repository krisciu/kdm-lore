### Monsters vs Players

No two showdowns will resolve the same way. Players will have to plan their gear and keep their minds sharp to prevail.

### Build Gear

### Story Events
You will encounter 40+ story events that will shape the story of your unique campaign. Your decisions and discoveries affect how story events unfold. Story Events cover everything from setting up and fighting a monster to dramatic turning points in your settlements story.
