## Lore Notes

### Scarlet's Story
- Fought atop a flying monster (likely Dragon King)
- Gripped "reticulated horns" - detailed, net-like pattern on horns
- Almost torn off by rushing air during aerial combat
- Another survivor fired an arrow from the ground below
- Suggests dramatic mid-air showdown with a flying tyrant

### The Tyrant Slayer
- Named after slaying a "tyrant" - likely the Dragon King
- Uses Serpentine Tailbone as crafting resource
- From KDU #108: described as "a nuclear bow made from a serpentine tailbone"
- Connects Dragon King's serpentine qualities to its skeletal structure

### Serpentine Tailbone
- Dragon King indomitable resource
- Crafted into the Tyrant Slayer weapon
- Confirms Dragon King has serpentine/snake-like anatomy
- "Nuclear bow" suggests devastating power

### Combat Style
- Aerial combat on monster's back
- Coordinated attack with ground-based archer
- Extreme danger and athleticism required
