## Lore Notes

### Kale's Story
- Faced the White Lion in battle
- Battle took place on "stone-faced ground" - the Plain of Faces
- The White Lion was exhausted but still fighting ("gripped... with its exhausted hands")
- Endured the lion's devastating roar
- "Bowel-shaking rumble" - describes the physical impact of the roar
- Suggests survivor fought to the point where even the beast was exhausted

### The White Lion (Monster Details)
- Described as "shaggy beast" - confirms furry/maned appearance
- Has "row upon row of glistening teeth" - multiple rows like a shark
- Uses its "hands" not paws - anthropomorphic features
- Roars powerfully enough to shake one's bowels
- Can be exhausted but remains dangerous

### The Roaring Harmonica
- Named after the White Lion's devastating roar
- "Harmonica" suggests instrument-like sound production
- Crafted from Layered Maxilla resource

### Layered Maxilla
- White Lion indomitable resource
- Maxilla = upper jawbone
- "Layered" suggests multiple bone structures (matching "rows of teeth")
- Used in Roaring Harmonica gear crafting
