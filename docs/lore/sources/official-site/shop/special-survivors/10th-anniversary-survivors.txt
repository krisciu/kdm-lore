## Description

One extinguishing lantern after another, the grizzled foursome persevered. The insight gleaned from their life in the darkness has ignited a spark of ingenuity.

In celebration of 10 years since the release of the first Kingdom Death figure, we revisit the starting survivors of Monster: **Allister, Zachary, Lucy, and Erza**. A lantern decade into their survival, these reimagined figures show the ingenuity and grit required to endure the darkness.

## The Original Four

The canonical names of the four starting survivors in Kingdom Death: Monster are now confirmed:
1. **Allister** - Male survivor
2. **Zachary** - Male survivor  
3. **Lucy** - Female survivor
4. **Erza** - Female survivor

These are the four survivors who awaken at the start of every campaign, naked in the darkness with only the light of a lantern hoard.

## Seed Patterns

The 10th Anniversary Survivor figures are accompanied by Seed Patterns for Kingdom Death: Monster.

### What is a Seed Pattern?
A Seed Pattern represents a spark of crafting inspiration that accompanies insight gleaned about the world.

### How They Work
When survivors reach their insights, draw a Pattern. It will describe what to use and how to craft a brand new piece of gear. When these crafting elements are assembled a new idea takes physical form.

This introduces a new crafting mechanic tied to survivor insights.
