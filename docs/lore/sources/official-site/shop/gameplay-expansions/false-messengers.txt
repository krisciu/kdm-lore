## Description

Ripples of "what might have been" ordain the fates of those who follow. Expand your Kingdom Death: Monster games with these icons from imagined worlds.

## Lore Notes

This expansion introduces "False Messengers" - beings from imagined worlds that represent alternate possibilities or timelines. They are described as "icons from imagined worlds" whose ripples of "what might have been" influence the fates of survivors who follow them.

The concept suggests these are beings from potential realities that never came to pass, yet still exert influence on the world of Kingdom Death. They appear to offer guidance or leadership (as "messengers") but their nature is "false" - implying deception or unreality.
