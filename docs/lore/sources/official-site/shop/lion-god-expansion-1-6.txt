## Lion God Lore

Warped for untold lantern years by the tormenting whispers of an evil parasite, the last great ruler of the Silver City would be unrecognizable to their subjects if any were alive to see them today. Lacking the faintest glimmer of its former glory, the Lion God stalks the dead streets of its once-bustling kingdom in a mindless rage. Anything that comes within reach of its filthy, petrified claws is eaten or destroyed.

## Gameplay Overview

Use the maze-like terrain to your advantage, as the Lion God is fearsome and difficult to engage directly. If you manage to survive one of its brutal attacks, it might be wiser to play dead than to expose yourself to another attack.

## Game Information

The Lion God is a node 4 quarry monster, a magnificent challenge for the most ambitious settlements late in their campaign. This expansion replaces nothing, no such level of challenge exists in the core Kingdom Death: Monster campaigns.
