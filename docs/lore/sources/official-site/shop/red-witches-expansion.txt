## Combat Mechanics

### Red Witch Swap
Red Witches are shrouded in cloaks woven from the volatile threads harvested from the red-haired dragon. Harnessing its power, the red witches dissolve and reconstitute, moving instantly between cloaks.

Blinking around the showdown board, their power of transposition will befuddle the aim of struggling survivors.

### White Secrets
The cult's stories are imbued with memetic power. Learned stories live in the blood of the cultists. Sharing them has devastating effects for the uninitiated.

During showdowns, Red Witches will attack with powerful new stories, revealing new secrets, and devastating the survivors.

### Red Witch Blood Magic
The potent stories pulsing in the blood of White Speakers gives them strange sway over the vital fluid.

This power manifests as vigorous defenses in each witches' unique hit location deck.

### Red Witch Initiates
The swaddled initiates accompany the Red Witches, desperately trying to gain control over their Red Cloaks. Red Witches will use their hapless trainees to swap dangerously around the board. Although they are focused on their training, they will attack survivors that approach.
