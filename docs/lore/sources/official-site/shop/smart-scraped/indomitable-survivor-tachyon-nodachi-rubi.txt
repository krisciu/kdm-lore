## Lore / Description

Infinite reflections of kaleidoscopic colors blinded her eyes. She shut them to the painful light, feeling the strange current carrying her through the monster's mystifying bowels. Visions of her own death visited her panicked mind, replicating, rewinding, rewriting her gruesome ending until the epiphany froze her body. Its sudden stillness loosed her, slipping faster and faster for interminable ages until the pain of impact upon the stone-faced ground woke her. The monster wheeled around, straining its neck to peck open her heaving chest. The fatal wound was, but then was not. She struck back, spilling the monster's shimmering guts at her feet. From the mess she plucked a seed that blinked in and out of existence even as she held it fast in her fist.
