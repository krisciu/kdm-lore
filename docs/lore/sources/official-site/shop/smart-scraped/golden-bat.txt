## Lore / Description

Limit 1 per customer
Ensconced in its shining bower, the Golden Bat hears the gleaming of its gold hoard in its massive ears. It sings the lugubrious song of gold, imitating the sounds it perceives. Each song varies in intensity with the size of the monster's treasury. In the warm glow of its gilded nest the Golden Bat sings for a mate that never hears its song.
