## Lore / Description

Limit 1 per customer
A shriek startled Mox from her dreamless sleep. The sound of skittering claws disappeared into the gloom before she could make out their shape. Beside her, a form in fitful slumber lay bleeding. Rubbing the flaking ink from her eyes, she spied the spreading pool of blood wending its way among the cracked stone faces. Suddenly aware of the weighty staff clenched in her hand, she applied its pulsing light to her companion's injuries. As their wounds faded, she felt a sharp pain. Blood poured from her own hand, running along the curiously patterned grooves of the strange staff.
