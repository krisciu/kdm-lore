## Lore / Description

Lost archive treasures! Extremely limited quantity. Sold as is.
When a lauded Great Game Hunter house falls to ruin, their loss is compounded by generations of shame. The fallen family is stripped of its heraldry and its lineage is sold into servitude among the remaining houses. The highest patriarch to the lowliest footman are given ignoble roles, as weapon caddies or cannon fodder to maximize their public humiliation.
