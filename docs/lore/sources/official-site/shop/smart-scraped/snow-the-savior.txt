## Lore / Description

Legendary characters are born with a story to tell. Included character cards foretell a journey on a grand scale. Use only one legendary character card per campaign. This character's story unfolds throughout their lifetime.
When Snow was born she cried out, inconsolable and sleepless. In the hovel, the lanterns dimmed and the baby fell asleep. She dreamed only once as a baby and woke up a ruddy-faced youth. Clutching a staff bedecked with bright ribbons appearing from out of nowhere. Her feet black and tough from an unseen journey. When she awoke she was possessed of strange wisdom beyond her lantern years. When next she slept, she awoke a warrior in her prime, lean with hunger and robust with experience, clutching the staff topped with a vicious stone. When she awoke again she was in the full bloom of her power, hair streaked with grey, possessed of the power to fulfill the dreams of her settlement, her tenuous existence anchored to the settlement that bore her. Finally, she awoke, gnarled and papery, a husk whose substance lives vividly in another place.
