## Lore / Description

An indomitable collection. These seven survivors represent the most extreme triumphs over indomitable monsters. Indomitable monsters that stalk the darkness unchallenged tend to grow features not normally found in younger specimens of the species. Survivors brave and lucky enough to survive encounters with these monsters gain indomitable resources. These unusual components inspire new configurations of gear worthy of these hard won treasures.
Your campaign should include the monster from which the indomitable resource is won to build the Indomitable gear included with each survivor.
