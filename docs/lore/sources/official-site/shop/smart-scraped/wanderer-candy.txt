## Lore / Description

Wanderers are new to Kingdom Death: Monster with the release of the Gambler's Chest expansion. Any campaign can now add a wanderer, a mysterious stranger that makes your settlement their temporary home.
As they fight alongside your settlement, their own story unfolds. Secrets, skills, and more are shared by your visitor. Cultivate a relationship as the wanderer fights along with your survivors to protect your settlement. When they leave, as they all inevitably do, they will leave an indelible mark of their life on your campaign.
Wanderer Candy escaped a deathmach arena crumbling in flames. When she arrives, choking in smoke, she discovers that memories of a distant past weave a melancholy tale of longing for a brighter world.

1 x Candy hard plastic miniature
1 x Cola scenic base insert
1 x Kingdom Death 30mm base
3 x Knowledge cards
2 x Fighting art cards
1 x Glossary card
