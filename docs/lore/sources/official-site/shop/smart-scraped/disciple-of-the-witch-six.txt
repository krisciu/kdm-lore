## Lore / Description

Encore Edition: Limit 1 per customer.
The Sleeping Flower has 13 petals, which is as many disciples as the Flower Witch will ever keep. However, the fifth petal never uncurls, even when the flower is in full bloom. Its contents are a mystery to all but the Flower Witch, who privately muses that it will be the burden of the disciple that succeeds her, inheriting both her mask and her many mistakes.
Art: Lokman LamSculpture: Jonah Gilbert
