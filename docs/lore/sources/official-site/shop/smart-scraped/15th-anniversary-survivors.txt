## Lore / Description

15 Lantern Years
In celebration of 15 years since the release of the first Kingdom Death figure, we revisit the starting survivors of Monster, Allister, Zachary, Lucy, and Erza. Fifteen lantern years into their existence the pursuit of survival is replaced with a quest for perfection. Life and death still remain balanced on the edge of dice roll but the grizzled survivors have endured beyond expectation.
The 15th Anniversary Survivor figures are accompanied by an expanding armory of weapons wrought with purpose to take advantage of fortune and tenacity. A Blacksmith settlement location extension and a host of new tools and resources allows settlements to craft the wrought weapons of the 15th anniversary survivors.
The 15th lantern year of this journey has hardened our resolve. Kingdom Death has taken darkness of the past lantern years and crafted a path forward. Our journey continues to draw random events, impossible showdowns, and the rich rewards of bringing new stories to the world of Kingdom Death. Let's forge ahead together into 15 more lantern years of darkness!
