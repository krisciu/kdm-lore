## Lore / Description

Limit 1 per customer
The sea of golden grasses stretch over the plain of stone faces. Silken-haired beasts, picking strange paths through the waving stalks. The realm swarms with endemic life, uniquely adapted to living in the tall grass among the grasping White Lions.
Gurner
Vast arrays of highly sensitive taste buds line its digestive tract. As its meals break down, it adds the subtle flavors of marked territories, traces of dung, and teeming aquifers to its endless archive of tastes. Tumescent scent glands around it body can reproduce scents to aid in luring prey or reproducing the ammonia rich scent of the White Lion to ward off predators. Since it tastes its meals long after they are dissolved with bile, it maintains a constant expression of distaste.
Soft Pincer
Its flesh is so impossibly delicate that in its shallow pool habitat it becomes viscous, resembling slimy hummocks. Often mistaken for footholds in watery crossing, a poorly guarded foot makes a tasty meal for this opportunistic hunter. It leaves its watery domains to hang glittering eggs in scraggly thickets of nightmare trees. However holding its quivering shape while it makes the journey depletes its limited metabolic energy, causing it to dissolve into slime before it is able to return to the water.
Stone Shard Snapper
The twin hearts of the armored creature beat in the ocular cavities of its glowering shell. A favored delicacy of the White Lions, its stimulant laden organs inspire a monomaniacal obsession of exuberant item acquisition, organization, and display instincts within its primary predator.
