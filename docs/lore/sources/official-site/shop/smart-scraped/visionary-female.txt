## Lore / Description

Limit 1 per customer
Most live drab lives, nurturing fantasies of their world painted in bold colors. Visionaries are those few who come across relics that empower them and demand they take action. Often these individuals lead many to their deaths, building staircases of corpses they climb toward lofty ideals.
