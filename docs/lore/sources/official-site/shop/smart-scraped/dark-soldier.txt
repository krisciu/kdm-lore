## Lore / Description

The Dark Soldier is the result of a collaboration between Adam & Lokman, exploring some well established tropes in fantasy art. Originally intended as a small line of Generic Hero Classes, the results were so compelling and un-generic, each hero's appearance told so many exciting stories that we wanted to integrate them into the KD world but so far nothing concrete has emerged.
Every demon is born with a soul, their first act of allegiance is to cauterize it from their body makes space for the astounding power. In the ultimate act of defiance, the Dark Soldier preserved the spark of will, trading demonic power for rebellion. She alone will discover what power a demon's soul might hold.
