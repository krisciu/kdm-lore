## Lore / Description

Vignettes of Death are a great diversion from the intensity of Monster campaigns or an easy way to introduce new players, dipping their toes into the fathomless ocean of Kingdom Death: Monster.
A squabbling, unlikely alliance rallies around Gnostin, determined to stop a destructive new quarry or die trying. Transfigured by radiation, the Screaming Nukealope’s existence is constant pain for itself and its would-be hunters alike. Embody the wits and teamwork of Gnostin’s close knit company to achieve his envisioned perfect ending.
Using ready-to-play gear grids, survivor vignette cards, and limited components from your Monster core game makes the vignette a quick way to dive into a brand new story.
