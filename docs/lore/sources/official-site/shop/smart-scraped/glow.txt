## Lore / Description

Legendary characters are born with a story to tell. Included character cards foretell a journey on a grand scale. Use only one legendary character card per campaign. This character's story unfolds throughout their lifetime.
Glow was born with glamorous future. Between fantasy and flesh a vast chasm of questions. A precocious child, she was a clever, nimble-fingered artificer. Piece by piece she would manifest the heart-aching enchantress glittering bright in the darkness.
