The strain disturbed her sleep, just above the persistent rumbling din that hung over the settlement. She followed the fragile song, drifting from one pool of lantern light to the next until it the sound was at her feet. raising the ruptured lantern, she heard the familiar refrain sung by someone lost in memory. Incandescent ooze ran down the twisted filigree. She threw back her head and let the light pour into her mouth and the song suddenly burst forth from her scorched throat.
