## Lore / Description

Limit 1 per customer
Drawing on the pipe, its chilling smoke slackened her furiousy clenched hands, the Dark Confidant seethed underneath the drooping stupor. Preparing herself for another muttering visitation.
The sibilant whisper propelled flecks of foamy, revolting spittle into her hair. The small of its breath made her gag. But as the hushed tones grew into meaning the maddening ardor returned, burning in her chest. Toxic, brutally jealous, and explosively violent.
