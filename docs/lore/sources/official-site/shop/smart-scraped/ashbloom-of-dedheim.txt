## Lore / Description

A mouse-like creature took shelter in the gourd. Accepting the protection of the ever-thickening rind in the cruelest season, the creature finally gave in and nibbled a morsel from the fruit's foul flesh.
The creature quickly grew to outsized proportions and outsized fury. When Ashbloom emerged, her overgrown steed instinctively waited at her side. Mounting, she sorrowfully rides through Dedheim cruelly skewering any who would carry even an inkling of escape in their hearts.
