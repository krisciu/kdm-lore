## Lore / Description

Percival was a member of a small order called the Black Knights. The Black Knights were founded by a militaristic settlement that hoped to conquer the darkness and provide a safe haven for all. A great crusade called the Black Knights into action and Percival left her home, never to be seen again.
Before leaving, though, she commanded her loyal companion, a young puppy, to wait for her safe return. It still waits to this day.
