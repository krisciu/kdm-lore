Monster is cooperative game for up to 4 players. Play survivors ekeing out an existence in the overwhelming darkness. Your story unfolds in a campaign that is played over many nights at the game table or ends quickly in bitter defeat.
Every decision matters. Every space moved, every resource spent, every governing principle chosen - all have lasting impact on this highly replayable and challenging game.
Campaigns
Embark on a 30 lantern year campaign. With so much emphasis on player choice, no two campaign are alike.Monsters vs PlayersFight 8 monsters with rising levels of difficulty (except for the finale, it has only 1 level and it's HARD!) Every encounter, even with the same monster, is diverse and valuable. No two showdowns will resolve the same way. Players will have to plan their gear and keep their minds sharp to prevail.
Build GearIn Monster, survivors will craft gear using resources earned from defeating monsters. Each survivor can carry up to 9 pieces of gear. What gear you bring and how you arrange it can unlock advantages that may make the difference between life and death.
Story EventsYou will encounter 40+ story events that will shape the story of your unique campaign. Your decisions and discoveries affect how story events unfold. Story Events cover everything from setting up and fighting a monster to dramatic turning points in your settlements story.
*Includes the updates found in the Legendary Card Pack.
Get a taste of the game with Kingdom Death: Simulator. Play online, solo or with friends, in a setting eerily suited for a night around the game table.
