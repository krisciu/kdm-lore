## Lore / Description

Declining to wish upon a frozen star, Brave sets out to fulfill his own wish. He carries Hollow's husk upon his back, journeying to Dedheim to restore the spark of life to her twisted remains.
Strange fires in the sky guide him to a pitted field of freshly dug graves. Brave steals curiously growing seeds from the rot-fumed barrows in the vain hope they will grow to something useful.
