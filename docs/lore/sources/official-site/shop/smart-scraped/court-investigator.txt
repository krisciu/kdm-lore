## Lore / Description

Limit 1 per customer
The Court Investigator is the result of a collaboration between Adam & Lokman, exploring some well established tropes in fantasy art. Originally intended as a small line of Generic Hero Classes, the results were so compelling and un-generic, each hero's appearance told so many exciting stories that we wanted to integrate them into the KD world but so far nothing concrete has emerged.
Conjurers, illusionists, and magic artificers of all creeds enter covenants of exchange with the sources of their magic. Scoundrels may seek to circumvent the immense cost of magic by stealing it. Fiends may seek to abuse its power. These magical crimes are investigated and prosecuted by the Court. Court Investigators are often called to the scene of magical crime in foreign dimensions of existence and must be vigilant to follow local code and custom in higher planes and demonic underworlds.
