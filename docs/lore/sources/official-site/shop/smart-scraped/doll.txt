## Lore / Description

Collector's Edition: Limit 1 per customerEncore Edition: Limit 2 per customer.
Built with fanatical care, the automata was a gift to the newborn heir of an island rich in mystical fresh water. Playing with her young charge in a strange pool, the doll suddenly started to speak foreboding prophesies that vexed the island's rulers. Thrown far into the depths of the Rust Ocean, the mechanical wonder's water-logged voice still foretells its ghastly predictions.Artwork: Wenjuinn PngSculpture: Thomas David
