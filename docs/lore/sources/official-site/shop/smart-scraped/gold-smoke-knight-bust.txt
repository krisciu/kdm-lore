## Lore / Description

Limit 1 per a customer
The ultimate Gold Smoke Knight captured in its smoldering resplendence, a huge bust dripping with detail. Magnifying the dynamic details of the original sculpt and adapting it for the format. Perfect for painting or collecting.
Thank you fans! With the success of the Butcher Bust, we invested both your support and wonderful feelings into... purchasing a large format laser cutter! With this new technology, we were able to fabricate large format busts far more efficiently and bring the price of these limited edition items down! Woo progress!
Sculpture: Team Death
The Gold Smoke Knight Bust is packaged in a custom box emblazoned with a sculpted Gold Smoke Knight crest and packed with care in foam :
1 x Gold Smoke Knight bust
1 x Gold Smoke Knight Crest
1x Oversized signed and numbered collector's card packaged into a black envelope (not mounted to the box like the photo shows, mount it if you like!)
