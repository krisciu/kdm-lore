## Lore / Description

Legendary characters are born with a story to tell. Included character cards foretell a journey on a grand scale. Use only one legendary character card per campaign. This character's story unfolds throughout their lifetime.
The mounting evidence of close scrapes and inexplicable escapes invites sideward glances wherever she stops long enough to be known. In her hands, anything can be the ultimate tool for survival.
