## Lore / Description

The shearing winds battered her body, tugging her wrinkled skin taut, seizing her age-weary joints, aching in her dusty bones. She leapt, driven by grizzled spite, into the vortex of shrieking air, driving her blade into the monster's sagging breast.
In the sudden stillness beyond the killing blow, she plucked a feather sailing silently through the air. In the instant of contact, the weft of time shrouded her from the world, inside its cocoon her body boiled, disintegrating and coalescing in an impossible moment. Released, a vibrant echo of her own life, breathing easy with newfound lightness in the chaotic aftermath.
