## Lore / Description

Those who dwell in the domain of the Ringtail Fox mark time by the Blushing Owl’s plumage. The great bird’s hormones respond to seasonal vapors that emanate from the swamp causing drastic changes to the shades and hues of its long thick feathers. As it gazes into still water, its mandible flushes a hue of bright pink as it is startled by its new appearance, embarrassed by its own reflection.
Art : Caitlin Hackett Sculpture: Thomas David*We forgot to add the little branches that are part of the monsters design to the model, we will update the photos here to reflect them once we do. Thanks!
