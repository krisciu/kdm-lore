## Lore / Description

limit 2 per customer
The shining wavelength of pure gold is the only visible wavelength for the otherwise sightless bat. The monster fills its habitat with gold-trapped survivor remains, depicting arcane messages only understood by its species. Foltron, one of the most flashy of the Golden Bat hunters, wields a gilded weapon, baiting the monster to follow as the others use their relative obscurity to hunt the darting creature.
