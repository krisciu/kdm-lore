## Lore / Description

Once sky had no day. There was a Shadow that was sad, it could only play in small light of a lantern. The Shadow found a hole in the sky and decided to steal enough lanterns to fill it. It took many generations, and when it was done the shadow slept under its big light, dreaming dreams about how it would play. When it awoke, all of the light was gone! At the center of the hole in the sky, was a tiny shinning entity, with a great big mouth. The shadow named the tiny thing the sun and they played forever.
A showdown with the Sunstalker will test players ability to position their survivors and make coordinated attacks. Making use of their own shadows to turn the tides of the battle. Its rewards grant new long range options and an evasive burst damage armor set, that is low on actual armor levels.
Sunstalker is a node 3 quarry monster. Hunting these quarries allows settlements to take on the final chapters of their story, crafting powerful new tools and unlocking new skills to face the later parts of the game. This expansion replaces the Phoenix in Kingdom Death: Monster campaigns.
In addition to a late-game quarry for your core game, this expansion includes a brand new 25 lantern year campaign, People of the Sun. This tells the story of settlements growing under the prismatic rays of the Sunstalker. A brand new civilization with unique stories, advantages, and challenges leading up to an operatic last stand. This expansion includes all new materials and rules to play a wildly different campaign of Monster.
It includes:
Sunstalker sprues (Sunstalker monster, Sunstalker Armor Kit, and People of the Sun Miniatures (Male & Female))
