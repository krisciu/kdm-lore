## Lore / Description

The Dragon King's species is long dead. It remains alone, clinging to the memories of its once mighty race. Its destructive moods swing wildly from impotent rage to obsessive nostalgia. It stalks the darkness, lashing out at anything it meets. Survivors that run across the moody monster usually fall prey to the unseen waves of ruinous pain that emanate from the monster's glowing heart. Those survivors lucky enough to drive off the monster will be amply rewarded with a trove of new armaments crafted from the abandoned husk of the monster's body.
The Dragon King is a node 3 quarry monster. Hunting these quarries allows settlements to take on the final chapters of their story, crafting powerful new tools and unlocking new skills to face the later parts of the game. This expansion replaces the Phoenix in Kingdom Death: Monster campaigns.
In addition to a late-game quarry for your core game, this expansion includes a brand new 25 lantern year campaign, People of the Stars. This tells the story of a settlement raised by the Tyrant, an ancient being molding the survivors in the image of its lost civilization. Will the survivors ascend to the stars or fall short? People of the Stars includes unique stories, advantages, and challenges leading up to final judgement. This expansion includes new materials and rules to play a wildly different campaign of Monster.
