## Lore / Description

Collector's Edition: Limit 1 per customer.
Encore Edition: Limit 2 per customer.
Hellebore’s ancestors descended the thin atmospheres of their settlement to launch their papery boats into the frozen seas. Shivering, they navigate the ice floes in search of the floating nests of the lantern flame gull. Each generation harvested a single silver down feather from the shaggy chicks slumbering in nests of hollowed bone. With the passing of countless lanterns, Hellebore’s lineage created the feather mantle she inherits, insulating against the piercing cold. Her hands confidently grasp the frozen dagger that would burn the hands of any unprepared survivor.
