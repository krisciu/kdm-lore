## Lore / Description

Spewing and hacking, Ledla stumbled out of the kaleidoscopic cloud crying many-hued tears. From within the obscuring smog, wretched cries of guilty conscience expired invisibly. She collapsed, clutching the flaccid face,  the springy resonance of the waxy monster hide hitting the ground played a note of absolution to her fading consciousness.
The indomitable monsters that stalk the darkness unchallenged tend to grow features not normally found in younger specimens of the species. Survivors brave and lucky enough to survive encounters with these monsters gain indomitable resources. These unusual components inspire new configurations of gear worthy of these hard won treasures.
