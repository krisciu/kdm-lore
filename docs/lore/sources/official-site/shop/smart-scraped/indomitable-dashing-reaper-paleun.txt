## Lore / Description

The thunder of hooves was upon her before she could scramble to her feet. Suddenly she was plucked into the air, her armor snagged between two massive gnashing teeth. Bouncing over the stone faced ground, she twisted wildly, searching for a handhold. Grabbing the froth-soaked fur she felt the pulsing, bulging edges of the Screaming Antelope’s straining neck. Her grip wouldn’t last. She lashed out with her bladed fists. The braying of the monster ceased. A shower of hot ichor spilled from its wounded throat. Something hard sailed out of the wound striking her head. Her grip failed and she tumbled to the ground, landing alongside the strange stone. The monster slid past her, gouging the ground with its silent undermaw.
