## Lore / Description

Wanderers are new to Kingdom Death: Monster with the release of the Gambler's Chest expansion. Any campaign can now add a wanderer, a mysterious stranger that makes your settlement their temporary home.
As they fight alongside your settlement, their own story unfolds. Secrets, skills, and more are shared by your visitor. Cultivate a relationship as the wanderer fights along with your survivors to protect your settlement. When they leave, as they all inevitably do, they will leave an indelible mark of their life on your campaign.
Wanderer Aeneas arrives looking for a snack but stays to tell her story at the dinner table.
