## Lore / Description

Limit 1 per customer**
Lagomorph incubation is a tedious rite lasting several lantern years. Once the shell of the lagomorph hardens, survivors lend their own bodys warmth to incubating the humming eggs. Secrets and stories passed down from one incubator to the next, shared in the idle days of incubation. The eggs abide, absorbing their muffled confidences.
