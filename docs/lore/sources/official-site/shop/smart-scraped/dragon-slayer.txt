Encore Edition: Limit 1 per customer
The Dragon Slayer is the result of a collaboration between Adam & Lokman, exploring some well established tropes in fantasy art. Originally intended as a small line of Generic Hero Classes, the results were so compelling and un-generic, each hero's appearance told so many exciting stories that we wanted to integrate them into the KD world but so far nothing concrete has emerged.
The Dragon Slayers are demi-giants with voracious appetites for dragons. Their physiology is accustomed to growing wildly with every dragon meal they consume and they hunt dragons with single-minded focus. The Dragon Slayers were eventually convicted of depleting the dragon species in the Mirrored Courts, and sentenced to miniaturization. Now the Dragon Slayers are kept in check by shrinking so small, they hardly pose a threat to any dragon. The most cunning and powerful will find a way to feast on dragons, growing first to a regular size, and dreaming always of towering above the heads of their oppressors.
