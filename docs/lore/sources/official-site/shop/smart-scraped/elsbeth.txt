## Lore / Description

Elsbeth was born from her mother's armpit. So the settlement always said she never knew the way. Breathlessly struggling to keep up with the others as they journeyed through the gloom.
Often her directionless senses leaves her in peril, but occasionally a glint of opportunity is found lost in the gloom alongside her.
