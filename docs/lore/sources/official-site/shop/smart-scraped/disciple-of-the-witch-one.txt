## Lore / Description

Encore Edition: Limit 1 per customer.
A coven of disciples that assist in the care of the Abyssal Woods; clearing trails, calming boiling rivers, balancing bacterial colonies, and most importantly, clearing the clots from the infinity web that encloses the vacuum at the heart of the forest.
The staves of the disciples are topped with a dense mineral, so saturated with colors that it appears black to human eyes. The mineral is the heart of a plant that lives in warm nests deep within a great inverted mountain. The Flower Witch teaches its disciples to use their staves to manipulate plant life cycles, commanding them to grow or wither.
