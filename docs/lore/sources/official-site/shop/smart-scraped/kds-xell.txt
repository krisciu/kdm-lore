## Lore / Description

As she ran after the monster, exerting her muscles beyond their limits, color bled from the scene. Black vibrating outlines of lean, trampling limbs and massive twisting hulks of sodden fur flashed back and forth like pictures blinking through the darkened terrain ahead. With a roar that drowned the monstrous braying, she swung for the strangely still haunch, sinking the blade with a wet crunch. Suddenly, the scene was animated again, the beast collapsed, tumbling and skidding, painting the ground in red, before finally stopping in a twisted heap of heaving gore. Color filled her world again, creeping in from the edges, intensifying. Suddenly everything was light, and nothing was visible in its shine. She listened closely, beyond her own ragged breath, for any signs of life.The indomitable monsters that stalk the darkness unchallenged tend to grow features not normally found in younger specimens of the species. Survivors brave and lucky enough to survive encounters with these monsters gain indomitable resources. These unusual components inspire new configurations of gear worthy of these hard won treasures.
