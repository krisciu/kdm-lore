## Lore / Description

At the end of the longest hunt, Lenore faced the hoary beast. Distracted by the dancing flame in her eye the monster reached out to pluck the bauble from her skull, exposing its soft belly. It was just enough.
The indomitable monsters that stalk the darkness unchallenged tend to grow features not normally found in younger specimens of the species. Survivors brave and lucky enough to survive encounters with these monsters gain indomitable resources. These unusual components inspire new configurations of gear worthy of these hard won treasures.
