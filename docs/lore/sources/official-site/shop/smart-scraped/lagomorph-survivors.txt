## Lore / Description

Encore Edition: Limit 2 per customer
The survivors live under a canopy of glistening tendrils that disappear into an infinite horizon they cannot reach, no matter how long they journey. When they are disturbed, the quivering tendrils fill rapidly with twisting obstructions that burst forth from the engorged threads. Commonly, fleshy lagomorph creatures emerge shrieking, attacking the settlement. In the undisturbed silence, the survivors hear the tendrils singing in their language.
