## Lore / Description

Limit 1 per customer
Released at our painters scale, perfect for hobbyists.
Gunborg remembers too much. Lifetimes of faithlessness crowd out her sense of self, leaving a being driven by recurring impressions, an instinct to betray the ones who hold her dear. A parasitic weapon greedily feeds of her basest drives, preserving her vacant existence.
