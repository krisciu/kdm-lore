## Overview

**Kingdom Death: Monster is a game with countless emergent possibilities. Monster nodes provide a guide to adding new expansions to your game, curating a unique mix of changes to the story of your settlement each time you start a fresh campaign.**

## Monster Campaigns

A campaign of Kingdom Death: Monster starts when desperate survivors suddenly awaken in the darkness. If they survive, their fragile settlement will continue to grow, face new challenges, and reveal the secret of their existence until they reach the finale of their story.

### Campaign Elements
- **Quarry monsters** - Survivors hunt these for resources
- **Nemesis monsters** - Arise to challenge the settlement's existence
- **Core monsters** - Define your story
- **Finale monsters** - Bring your story to its glorious end

### Campaign Timeline
Campaigns take place over a span of lantern years. Each lantern year you will:
- Grow your settlement
- Hunt a quarry in the darkness OR fend off an assault from a nemesis
- Survive long enough to face the core monster at the heart of your story
- Meet your end in the finale

## Monster Nodes Explained

Monsters are organized by their node in your campaign. Nodes indicate:
- The **type** of monster (quarry, nemesis, core, finale)
- The **challenge level** indicated by a number

### Quarry Nodes (NQ1-NQ4)
Quarry monsters arrive in your campaign in node order: **NQ1, NQ2, NQ3, NQ4**

When a quarry monster is added to your campaign, you can:
- Hunt it to reap the rewards of triumph
- Or perish in surprising new ways

### Nemesis Nodes (NN1-NN3)
Nemesis monsters arrive at designated points on the timeline to challenge your settlement's existence.

### Core Monster (Co)
Each campaign has ONE core monster. The delicate ecological balance between a settlement's survival and the darkness teeming with monsters is embodied in this lynchpin foe.

### Finale Monster (Fi)
Campaigns have one finale monster - your settlement's final challenge! The many lantern years of campaigning have led to this moment.

## Core Game Monster Nodes

## Adding Expansion Monsters

### General Rule
When you add an expansion, remove any monster of the same node from the settlement's timeline and quarry list (erase its corresponding story events, showdowns, and encounters).

### Monster Crests
Expansion content is marked with unique monster crests, allowing for quick installation and removal between campaigns.

## Modified Node Rules for Legacy Expansions

Some older expansions (Slenderman, Manhunter, Lion Knight) can be converted to the modern node system:

### [NN2] Slenderman
- **Remove**: King's Man from timeline
- **Add LY6**: Story Event - It's Already Here
- **Timeline**:
  - LY9: Slenderman Level 1
  - LY19: Slenderman Level 2
  - LY28: Slenderman Level 3

### [NN1] Manhunter
- **Remove**: Butcher from timeline
- **Add LY5**: Story Event - Hanged Man
- **Timeline**:
  - LY10: Manhunter Level 2
  - LY16: Manhunter Level 3
  - LY22: Manhunter Level 4

### [NN2] Lion Knight
- **Remove**: King's Man from timeline
- **Add LY6**: Story Event - An Uninvited Guest
- **Timeline**:
  - LY8: Lion Knight Level 1
  - LY12: Lion Knight Level 2
  - LY16: Lion Knight Level 3

## Key Lore Points

1. Survivors "suddenly awaken in the darkness" at campaign start
2. The campaign tells the story of revealing "the secret of their existence"
3. There's a "delicate ecological balance" between settlements and monsters
4. Core monsters are the "lynchpin" of this balance
5. Four distinct campaigns with different narrative focuses:
   - People of the Lantern: The Watcher's judgment
   - People of the Sun: The Ancient Sunstalker
   - People of the Stars: The Dragon King's tyranny
   - People of the Dream Keeper: The Gambler's games
6. "Atnas the Child Eater" - a dark nemesis name revealing brutal world
