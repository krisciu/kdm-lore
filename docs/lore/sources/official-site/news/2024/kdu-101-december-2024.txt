### Jaggerman82's Atnas
"Wishes you all a Merry Christmas." This Unseen Shooting Star wields jaunty green horns and wears a luxurious red coat that looks worn with age (and sword fights).

**Lore Note:** Atnas (from Gambler's Chest) is referred to as "Unseen Shooting Star" - ties to the monster's ability to not be remembered and its sudden appearance.

### CaptainSalty's Atnas
