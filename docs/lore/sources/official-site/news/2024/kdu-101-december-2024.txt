## KDU#101 - Deathmas Cheer

**"What horrors has Atnas brought for Percival in festive wrappings?"**

A Deathmas sale awaits all you wonderful fans!

---

## Lore Details

### Atnas (Santa reversed)
- **Title:** Unseen Shooting Star
- **Description:** "Wields jaunty green horns and wears a luxurious red coat that looks worn with age (and sword fights)."
- **Nature:** A festive/holiday character
- **Appearance:** Green horns, red coat (worn from battle)

**Lore Note:** Atnas appears to be Kingdom Death's version of a holiday gift-bringer, but with a darker twist. The "Unseen Shooting Star" title suggests celestial connections, while the battle-worn coat indicates this figure has seen combat.

### Percival
- Featured character receiving "festive wrappings" from Atnas
- A named character in Kingdom Death lore (also appears in Pillar Survivors)
