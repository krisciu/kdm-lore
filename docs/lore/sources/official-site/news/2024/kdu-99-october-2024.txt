## KDU#99 - Golden Bats Fill the Night Sky

**"The Golden Bat builds the finest dowry, waiting for its mate that will never come. The halls of its cave..."**

---

## Lore Details

### The Golden Bat
- **Behavior:** Builds elaborate dowries (collections of treasure)
- **Tragedy:** Waits for a mate that will never come
- **Habitat:** Lives in caves with "halls"
- **Nature:** Suggests a solitary, perhaps immortal creature doomed to wait eternally

**Lore Note:** The Golden Bat's existence is defined by futile waiting. It accumulates treasures as a dowry for a mate that doesn't exist or cannot arrive, giving it a deeply tragic dimension. The cave with "halls" suggests the bat has created an elaborate dwelling.

### Erza of Dedheim
From community spotlight: "Under orders from Grozharous the Pale Turnip King, Erza guards the black gates, preventing the dead residents of Dedheim from spilling out in..."

**Lore Note:** This reveals:
- **Dedheim** - A location inhabited by the dead
- **Grozharous the Pale Turnip King** - A ruler/entity commanding Erza
- **Black Gates** - Barriers that contain the dead
- **Erza** - Guards these gates under orders
- The dead apparently want to "spill out" - suggesting they're confined but restless

### Phoenix Hunt Reenactment
- A ceremonial or commemorative event
- Survivors recreate/perform the hunting of a Phoenix
