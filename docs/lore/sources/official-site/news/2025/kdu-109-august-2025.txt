## KDU #109 - We've Come Home With Plastic!

Team Death returns from Indianapolis energized from our annual opportunity to meet our amazing fans. We'd like to thank any and all who demoed a Lion, painted for a contest (or just for fun), campaigned at our playspace, or just swung by to say hello!

This year we added an additional table to our playspace as well as an additional demo table. The playspace featured two full length campaigns and two cinematic showdowns featuring the Pariah and Red Witches, both of which are en route to backers as we speak.

We'd like to take the opportunity to extend a Ivory Dragon-sized thank you to all of our Volunteers of Death. Nothing in the playspace would be remotely possible if it weren't for their dedication and generosity.

So many amazing new models saw their debut at Gen Con, and they're all available on our webstore for the first time! 

### Survivors of Death II
Introduces four new characters to the Plain of Faces:
- Snow the Savior grew up before our very eyes
- Percival wore a brand new Sci-fi ensemble (in two different scales)
- Erza went on a quest
