## KDU#108 - Killennium returns to your region

Another new killennium arrives. The Killennium Butcher vignette reprint arrives at your regional Kingdom Death warehouse. In the meantime, Team Death is already in Indianapolis erecting the glorious Kingdom Death Gencon booth. A King's Man procession is well underway.

To celebrate this herculean undertaking, we are encouraging our fans to shop our regional warehouses this month with generous Gencon pricing on expansions and pinups. A restock of Vignette of Death - Killennium Butcher and game sleeves in your region!

## Regional Distribution

Kingdom Death is a worldwide hobby and our awesome fans live in every corner of the world. This past year, we've made an effort to make new hard plastic releases like Indomitable Survivors and more available for shipping as close to our fans as possible.

KD HQ will remain our flagship location for new resins and limited releases since it is the heart of the project and our amazing production team is here nearly every day to make these releases possible.

## July 2024 Releases (All Regions!)

- **Vignettes of Death - Killennium Butcher** - Reprint available
- **Premium Card Sleeve Sets** - Luxury game accessories

## Gencon 2025

As you read this, Team Death is sweating through our Gencon setup. The booth will be better than ever! We're preparing miniatures and more to make their Gencon debut. Team Death will be at the show in Indianapolis, IN from July 31st to August 3rd.

We will once again feature Kingdom Death Simulator at our booth. The **Kingdom Death Play Area is also expanding**. Here, ticketed events of all kinds (Sold out!) will run all Gencon long! Visit the event hall and strike a plunderous pose in front of the Black Knight's hulking remains.

If you are traveling out to Gencon this year, we hope you'll stop by the KD booth and say hello! Stay for the exclusive Gencon premieres at the booth, enjoy a gruesome survivor death at our demo, or check out the KDS display complete with Dark Architects to answer your questions!

## Make Room In Your Suitcase

The first reprints of the sold out, genre-defining board game, *Kingdom Death: Monster* are at Gencon!!!

Debuting in very limited quantities exclusively at our Gencon booth while we prepare the incoming games for sale at our partner warehouses for our post convention celebration sale in August!

## Community Spotlight

Team Death may have flown out to Gencon, but the community spotlight is always packed with high flying highlights! This month, we have a squadron of Croc Killers, an atomic tyrant slayer, a smiling spine-cialist, and a shipper who's the total package!

### Croc Squad
We have to raise a blood glass to IcariumVN for completing this fine set of Crimson Crockery survivors. The painter produces a grim effect on the ensemble with a mix of muted earth and skin tones. The bright cold bloodglass pops through the gritty texture of the rest of the paint.

### Scarlet Slayer
Scarlet wields the Tyrant Slayer, a nuclear bow made from a serpentine tailbone. Bender082 has made another masterpiece! True to Cherrylich's original art, our hero wears a nervous demeanor even as she is clad in indomitable Dragon bone, very precise detailing on the armor in particular.

**Lore Note:** The Tyrant Slayer is described as "a nuclear bow made from a serpentine tailbone" - this suggests the Dragon King's serpentine qualities extend to its skeletal structure.

### Smiling Jackel
Jackel was a bitter survivor with a one-sided rivalry. Scorned from stolen valor, she turned her rival into a barbed sickle. Honorable_dungeon-master-li's Jackel paint captures the simultaneously vicious and seductive attitude of this seed pattern survivor. Amazing color on the vertebrae and the spine-tingling armor.

**Lore Note:** Jackel is described as a "seed pattern survivor" with a dark backstory - she was scorned from stolen valor and turned her rival into a barbed sickle. This provides insight into the brutal nature of survivor relationships and the dark origins of some weapons.

### Special Delivery
SFCdaddio's Samantha Haulage Cargos (affectionately dubbed by some in the community as "Shipping-Chan") is all ready to hurry up and wait. 'Waiting in the Railyard' was a special Black Friday only model to celebrate our at-the-time 300k over budget shipping costs. This Shippy paint is stunning and poised even while her irritation shines through!
