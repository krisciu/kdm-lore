## KDU #106 - Underground Fight Club

More is springing from underground than just spring flowers, the **Mole (Talpagoria)** emerges with a hunger for necrotic flesh.

An **Illuminated Figure** draws the unwitting survivors into the monster's domain. Indomitable Poison Partisan Ritika enters the fray, alongside the painters scale Echoes of Death Thief variant, and the cocky Great Game Hunter Bravado.

In addition the **White Speaker - Blood Mage** model returns in the form of our first Dark Treasury Preorder. A highly sought after figure offered again exclusively through Dark Treasury.

The Dark Treasury is provided by Kingdom Death to manage your kickstarter pledge rewards, preorders, and prizes! Connect the Dark Treasury to a Kingdom Death shop account to ship your items when and where you want!

## Community Spotlight

### Blue Moon - Lunar Twilight Knight
Tindol brings us a vision of the Twilight Knight in the light of the first new moon of the year. Elegant purples and blues wrap around the swordsman's body to match his hair and accentuate his eyes and lips. The colors culminate into a sharp sheen effect on the namesake sword. Quite chic.

### Battlecry - Barbarian Lucy
**Lore Note:** From the time of her birth, Barbarian Lucy has fought through constant nightmares real and dreamt.

Minisforwar has given Lucy a unique and vibrant look, accentuating the deep striations on her leg and core muscles. A mini worthy of a war cry.

**Character Detail:** Barbarian Lucy's life has been defined by fighting through nightmares since birth - suggesting a connection to the disturbing dream-like nature of existence in the Kingdom Death world.

### Dance Maccabre - The Necromancer
**Lore Note:** The Necromancer is an early generic character, starting its life as an exercise in exploring familiar tropes and emerging as a richly imagined story. Her story is a familiar one, she cast a spell to revive her lover, resulting in the macabre scene you see before you.

Toadpainting gives us a crisp rendition of the necromancer with tight contours and a rich skin tone. The way her beloved matches her hair is a spectacular touch.

**Character Detail:** The Necromancer attempted to resurrect her dead lover through magic, with tragic results. This establishes that resurrection magic exists in the KD universe but comes with grave consequences.

### Morgan Tastes Bitter
**Lore Note:** Morgan was one of his settlement's strongest. During battle with an **indomitable Phoenix**, he saw the truth and was able to enter a state of **lucid frenzy** before ultimately losing his head … physically.

**Character Detail:** Morgan's story reveals:
- Indomitable Phoenix encounters can lead to revelations ("seeing the truth")
- "Lucid frenzy" is an achievable mental state in battle
- Even the strongest survivors can fall
