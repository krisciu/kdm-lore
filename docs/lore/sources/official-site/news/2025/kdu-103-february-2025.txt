## Community Spotlight

### Texred's 15th Anniversary Zachary
"Texred's 15th Anniversary Zachary is a certified hunk. Looking absolutely yoked in his Wrought Lantern Mantle, it's clear Zachary spent 15 years pumping iron in the Wrought Ironworks."

**Lore Notes:**
- **Wrought Lantern Mantle** - Armor piece from Wrought Ironworks
- **Wrought Ironworks** - A settlement location where gear is crafted
- Time passage: "15 years" suggests survivors can live and train for extended periods

### Toadpainter's Gunborg with Goblin Snarfer
"Toadpainter perfectly depicts the parasitic relationship of Gunborg and her beloved blade Goblin Snarfer. A truly toxic relationship, the sentient grand weapon feeds off its wedded wielder's basest drives."

**Lore Notes:**
- **Goblin Snarfer** - A sentient grand weapon
- **Parasitic Weapons** - Some weapons have consciousness and feed on their wielders
- **"Wedded" relationship** - Survivors can form bonds with their weapons
- The weapon feeds on "basest drives" - exploits the wielder's darkest impulses
