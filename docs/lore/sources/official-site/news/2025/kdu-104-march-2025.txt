## KDU #104 - The Rain Stalker Attacks

**False face upon false face, the Rain Stalker treads the waterlogged ground, ravenously seeking a familiar face, its own.**

In its way are a slew of novel survivors. Appearing in the first moments of spring, a new White Speaker cultist, the **Bloodmage**, arrives. Indulge in receiving and dishing out pain with the Male Fighter, and harness the power of the mighty Phoenix's **Time Stop** with indomitable survivor **Rubi's Tachyon Nodachi**.

Finally, a new survivor bust of the iconic **Hollow** makes its debut.
