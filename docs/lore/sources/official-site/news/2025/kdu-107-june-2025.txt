## Overview

Summer is upon us, and things are heating up on the glass coast. Kicking back at the boiling seaside, Summer Grimmory and Summer Aquanaut Erza are ambushed by the furious Orc Boss.

Summer Aya returns in a brand new scale to catch some rays alongside other seasonal releases like Summer Goth and Summer Death Dice. A new indomitable survivor, Tyrant Slayer Scarlet, dispatches the noble Dragon King to create the ultimate atomic bow. Finally, Temple Explorer re-emerges from the depths of the Archival Vaults she had been exploring.
