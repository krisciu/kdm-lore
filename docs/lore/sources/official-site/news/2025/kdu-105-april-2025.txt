## KDU #105 - Bloodthirsty Bunnies

The rites of spring are always a bloody mess among the Lagomorphs. Celebrate the season of fertility with sanguine births, monstrous moltings, joyful incubations, and endless bunny iterations!

The new indomitable **Paleun** squares off against the Screaming Antelope. Male Estate Hero makes his debut with some beta content in tow. Erza gets a new festive outfit, lovingly rendered in painter's scale. **Pascha** makes her twicefold return, encoring her variant sculpt and featuring in a brand new model alongside her sister.

A **Lagomorph Kit** skulks into the webstore, ready to scavenge whatever grisly meals it can partake in while the **Witch of the East Star** returns in bust form.

Finally, after overwhelming community demand, the **Black Knight's 3D Citadel Board** is available to the public...at an unprecedented new scale.

- She became enraged when wounds marred her "perfect physique"
- Her frustration created a "sparkling dust cloud"
- This dust gave her wounds a "lustrous shine"
- Suggests some kind of magical/supernatural transformation triggered by emotion
