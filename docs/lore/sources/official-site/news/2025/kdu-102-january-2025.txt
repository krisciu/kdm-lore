## Community Spotlight

### CaptainSalty's Smog Armor Set
"Let's take a beat to appreciate CaptainSalty's unique take on the Smog armor set. The mask effect on the model's face is very unique. It's giving a chilling Venetian mask effect."

**Lore Note:** The Smog armor set (from Smog Singers in Gambler's Chest) creates a distinctive mask-like appearance, connecting to themes of concealment and the strange music of the Smog Singers.

### Texred's Guinevere
"Born under a lantern eclipse, Guinevere was always hesitant to hunt. She showed her true battle prowess when her settlement was attacked."

**Lore Note:** This provides significant character lore:
- Guinevere was born during a "lantern eclipse" - a rare celestial event
- She was naturally hesitant about hunting
- Her combat skills emerged when defending her settlement
- This suggests survivors can have different personalities and motivations
