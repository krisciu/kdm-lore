Removed Innovations
Re move t he fo llow i ng innovati ons from the pool of
possible in n ovations: Language , Lantern Oven ,
Family, a nd Clan of Death .
New Innovations
T he Pe o ple of the Stars campaign starts with the
Dragon Speech inn ovati on, as noted on the Found-
lings st o ry event.
Bloodline and Empire are new home in novati ons.
The Radiant Orb takes the place of the Lantern
Oven a s your settlement's source of heat , but unlike
th e Lant ern Oven , it can only be gained when grant-
ed by s to ry events. Finally , Arena is a new education
inn o vat io n that is added to the innovation deck as a
Nightmare Training consequence.

Dragon Traits a nd C ons tellati o ns
Dragon Trails are a_ collection of abilities, fighting
arts. attnbute mod,rrers. disorders, secret fighting
arts. and s_urnames that survivors ga ,n throughout
the campaign.
Dragon Traits are fisted in the Constellation
section_ of the survivor record sheet. Throughout th is
expansion, Dragon Traits are mentioned in bold , red
text to remind players to mark them on their record
sheet as they are gained.
Once marked, Dragon Trails are permanent. Even if
a survivor loses the original source of that trait, they
are still considered to have t ha t Dragon Trait. For ex-
ample. curing the Destined disorder by end eavoring
at Bed does not remove t he Dragon Trait.
When a survivor has four Dragon T raits in a row
(vertically or horizontally), they trigg er the Faces in
the Sky s tory event and gain a constellation. When
survivors gain a constellation, they become one of
the People of the Stars.
Constellations are powerful upgrades available only
to the People of the Stars. The exact constellation
gained depends on which 4 Dragon Trails were used
to complete a row or column. For example, a survivor
who triggers t he event by having the Oracle's Eye
ability, the Unbreakable fighting art, 3+ strength, and
9+ courage, gains the Goblin Constellation.
Survrvors can only have one constellation. Once a
survivor has gained a constellation. they no longer
record new Dragon Traits on their record sheet. If a
survivor would gain two or more constellations at the
same lime. they choose which of them to gain.
The Tyrant
Periodicall y, the Tyrant will test the settlement's
prowess, guiding their development towards People
of the Stars and evaluating their progress. Failing
to measure up to its expectations often has dire
consequences.
Part of these tests are special nemesis encounters.
However, the Tyrant is not a traditional nemesis
monster, and the survivors may only face it when it
is explicitly listed on the timetine of the settlement's
record sheet.
Do not add the Tyrant to the Nemesis Monster list
on the settlement record she et. When choosing to
fight an unspecified nemesis, you may not select the
Tyrant. Furthermore, the settlement cannot choose
to face the Tyrant via a special showdown (such as
by using the Heart Flute ) or use the monster as the
basis for the Hunt Reenactment settlement event.
Tyrant Showdown
Move into Range and Attack
The Tyrant has Range: 3 and uses Move into
Range and Attack actions. When the monster is
instructed to Move into Range and Attack, end the
monster's movement 3 spaces away from the target.
If the monster is less than 3 spaces away, move it
until it is exactly 3 spaces away.
