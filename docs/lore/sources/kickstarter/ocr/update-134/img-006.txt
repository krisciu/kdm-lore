The Abyssal Woods will explore the chimerical and deceitful. The darkness
has never been closer.

At the settlement’s edge, the darkness is alive, teeming with shadows moving
with unknowable purpose. Only the bravest or most delusional will set foot
outside the soothing comforts of their cozy village. Will any be brave enough
to break the spell? This campaign is all about camouflage, concealment, and
crushed yearning
Revealing moments and pulling back the veil will be central to this story's
unfolding. So that players may enjoy its unfolding twists, we will look at
highlights from the campaign without revealing too much of its story.

This campaign's structure features a flexible node 2 quarry slot.
We recommend playing with the Flower Knight or Spidicules as
they are denizens of the dark woods. The Screaming Antelope
dovetails perfectly with the campaign's setting as well!

offering and a name. Its true face has been lost behind a
countless number of visages, a mystery even to itself

branches pulled towards the forest's beating heart. The
first liar of the dark woods slumbers in a vain effort to
escape the wake of deceit it has wrought for the sake
of its own survival.
