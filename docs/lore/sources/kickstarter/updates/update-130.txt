## Revamped Shipping Wave 1 on the Waves!

Revamped Shipping Wave 1 is now merrily making its way to our fulfillment centers around the world via a fleet of shipping vessels. Our previous estimates for end of July to early August fulfillment hold strong, and we look forward to reaching out backers and bakcers in about two weeks to confirm your shipping address for the wave.

Keep an eye on the lookout for an email in your inbox!

## Red Witches &amp; Pariah Expansion Preorders Coming Soon!

[IMAGE]

For those who missed out on the chance to acquire all of the releases they wanted from the upcoming shipping wave, we will be hosting preorders mid-month before fulfillment begins. These preorders will be run through our Dark Treasury, allowing for flexible shipping once they are released.

Shipping for these preorders will become available as soon as backer fulfillment is complete, so don't miss this final opportunity to pick up any items you've been eyeing!

## Gencon 2025 on the Horizon

[IMAGE]

Gencon 2025 is fast approaching, and we're looking forward to seeing everyone at the show! Next month's update will be a shorter affair as I dedicate most of my non-dev bandwidth towards prepping for the convention. With any luck, a few backers will have already received their Pariah and Red Witches expansions by then!

If you'll be at the convention, swing by our booth wearing your favorite Kingdom Death T-Shirt for a unique alternate art Gencon gear promo!!!!!!!

## Armor Set Updates

The Sculptor's Lantern has been glowingly brightly, as we give the range of Kickstarter miniatures a final pass before they head into engineering and finally to be tooled into pure calcified organ metal, like all Kingdom Death miniatures are.

Here are some recent highlights to share.

And then one of our biggest adjustments, an entire re-sculpt for Female B from the Gryphon Armor set, which we naturally took back to the drawing board to ensure she could be the best she could be!

## Ivory Dragon Rescan

Soooo I'm not thrilled to admit this one. As we started to dig into the engineering for the Ivory Dragon we realized that the scanning did not turn out very well. Due to the size of the parts and the insane fidelity of the hand sculpted details, we had a lot of parts that had lost the vast majority of their detail. Thankfully we found a hyper specialized partner with a proprietary piece of technology that were able to come to our rescue. We dispatched a team member to spend a few days with them, ensuring we got the best possible result.

Now its all done and we can resume engineering. The final model will serve as a unique finale monster, a quarry monster and a nemesis monster. As we are designing it so that each of its unique parts can be separated to battle on its own!

[IMAGE]

All of the remaining Campaigns of Death tools are currently being CNC'd. The Wise One, People of the Mirror Stone starting survivors, Dung Beetle Barons Ball, Eve and the Skyking Armor. The Dark Flower Armor arrived today and thusly, I am stoked to show it off. Scissor blades and sunflower capes galore!

[IMAGE]

We are committed to ensuring that everything we deliver is the absolute best we can muster. 

## June Webstore Releases

[IMAGE]

Time for some fun in the sun! Wait is that an ORC!?!??!!?

Just as Summer Grimmory didn't think it could get any worse, the Orc Boss from our "generic range" emerges from the archival depths of this ridiculous ocean metaphor! Designed by Zeen Chin and hand sculpted by Thomas David, this charming brute splashes down in hand poured resin, a crafting tradition from our past.

## Kingdom Death Simulator

As we prepare for potential, maybe, perhaps, crowdfunding later this year for our humble Simulator project. The Dark Architects have been hard at work polishing up the Red Witch Expansion, Pariah Expansion, Gamblers Chest Expansion and some new heirlooms to enhance the functionality of the experience.

Our hope, IF we do launch a campaign for it, would be to secure funding to really speed up its development and reach parity with Kingdom Death releases and Kickstarter releases. It would be amazing if things were more parallel, and the great wheel of development demands more talented people and resources to give us a much needed speed boost there.

I am honestly mixed. I take a lot of pride in Kingdom Death and while we may be the ETERNAL TURTLE of this race. There is nothing thats gonna stop us from crossing the finish line of this campaign, with a wake of quality game expansions and high quality miniatures following it. Wherein Kickstarter campaigns seem to play out in the following common ways:

1 - Rush the project to the finish, get it out the door ASAP, underbaking and underdelivering what was promised to keep as much money as possible.

2 - Overextended and running multiple Kickstarter projects at once. The money from every new project paying for the sins of the prior ones.

3 - Lost in the sauce. Overwhelmed, the team sorta falls apart, leaving it in limbo.

4 - The more rare, well-managed project that see's minor delays but delivers instilling confidence in fans.

We have sorta carved out our own bizarre path. THE LONG AND HARD WAY STRAIGHT THROUGH THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN. Where we could have cashed-in, we doubled down, and where we could have raced to a finish we went back and improved things. I don't think anyone has had scope creep like us and no one has over-delivered the way Kingdom Death continues to do so.

We continue, under the radar, in the darkness, a dim lantern marching with our unceasing steps. Unknown by most, our iconic black box a pure mystery for the new generation of gamers. And yet, almost everyday I get emails from enthusiastic new fans, expressing their excitement as they have just found us. They want to know more and... they are hoping our Core Game (which has been sold out since Jan) will be back in stock soon!

Soooooo For now, I will continue to heavily flirt with the idea of crowdfunding the sim. My priority is finishing this campaign, but if the team of Dark Architects feel like they can manage it, it might be the right move to get it up to speed.

The heirloom Wax Sealing stamp is currently in the works. So you know, you can seal envelopes and mail users letters and instant photos of your table setup. So they can use your photos for speedy set-up in their own dwellings!

Anyways, thanks for hanging out while I rant!

Q: Do you have any update on the ultimate terrain???

A: Great question! The sculptors and I have made a lot of headway on this project, and I’ve recently settled on some final decisions on how the pieces should be produced to maximize their functionality. I’m not ready to share any progress photos just yet, but it’s definitely a possible talking point for an update in the near future!

Q: In the sim, when the Pariah is released, what are the possibilities of having the level 3 showdown have an upside down option?

A: Oooooh, that would be fun! I think our focus first and foremost with the Pariah and Red Witches expansions are to implement them as they exist in real life into KDS as quickly as possible first. It might be something worth exploring after the expansions are released though!

Q: Do you have plans on adding more monster specific hunting events for old monsters, expansions???

A: That’s something I’d love to gauge the community on. Right now, I would say it is more likely we create more basic or monster agnostic hunt events than monster specific ones, but I’m happy to explore the idea of more monster specific hunt events if that is something the community is excited about.

Q: Now that the red witches are done how linked with the inverted mountain and griphon are they. I would prefur to play them first in the ideal situation and am happy to wait if you think they would be best played when one or both of those 2 are done.

A: All of our monster expansions are meant to play well a la carte. Any Inverted Mountain campaign specific and synergy content will be present in the Inverted Mountain campaign itself, not part of the Red Witches release. I think you should have a wonderful time if you decide to start by inserting the Red Witches into a campaign by themselves! 

Q: Will there be an opportunity to purchase the naked GCE armor kits for GenCon/Black Friday? There are 3 or 6 variants on the build guide and having only 1 set of each isn’t near enough pieces to build 3 (or 6) of each variant.

A: I’ve seen some demand for this! I don’t think we’ll be able to do anything about this for Gencon, but I’ll speak with the crew about the if it would be possible in the future.

Q:@poots can we have nice things, like Questing Allister and Ezra pls? :=)

A: Of course!
