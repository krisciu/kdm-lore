We've returned from our annual trip to the hallowed halls of the Indianapolis Convention Center and are busy at work ensuring a smooth fulfillment for everyone patiently waiting for their Revamped Shipping Wave 1 rewards! The team has come to regard our yearly trip to Gencon with much fondness, for good reason.

It is an incredible privilege to engage with the Kingdom Death community face-to-face, and though the four days of the convention can be demanding work, we always step off the convention floor with hearts filled with endearing fan interactions and motivations turbocharged to make the best version of Kingdom Death we can in the coming year.

## Core Game Restock

[IMAGE]

Due to the excellent work and commitment of our logistics team, we were able to air freight a pallet of core games to Indy in time for the show, and I am happy to report that interest from new fans discovering Kingdom Death for the first time remains at an all-time high! Our stock of core games disappeared in record time this year. For those who missed the opportunity to jump in on this limited restock, I am also happy to announce that a restock of core games has just arrived at our webstore!

## Gencon Webstore Sale

Speaking of the webstore, our traditional Gencon web sale is occurring right now as well. The full convention catalogue is available for those who did not have the opportunity to swing by the show in person this year.

One of the releases I’m super excited about this year is our newest entry in the Legendary Characters line, the debut of Snow the Savior in hard plastic! Snow in her many age milestones are absolutely iconic models from our early days, so it only made sense to we honor her with archival remasters that fully display the improved skills and expertise we have built up since that time.

[IMAGE]

Of course, she’s not the only character that has made an impact upon the history of Kingdom Death. One year ago, the community rallied around a beloved survivor by the name of “Crabman”, who stepped up heroically to defend his settlement until his ultimate demise. Today, Crabman and his story are forever immortalized in Survivors of Death 2, with the triumphs and tribulations of his life recreated via a unique pair of seed patterns.

[IMAGE]

In addition to our larger releases, this Gencon also saw the return of one of our most popular single models to date, Fade. The single release has been updated to be compatible with modern campaign frameworks, and includes some stunning new art!

[IMAGE]

Finally, I have been absolutely obsessed with the sheer detail and intricacy of our premium bust of the Flower Knight. The sculptors really knocked it out of the park with this one, and I just know there are going to be some jaw dropping paintjobs once it’s in the hands of our countless talented painters.

[IMAGE]

I don’t have nearly enough time to go over all of the goodies that are available from the con, so there’s plenty more to discover aside from what’s been mentioned here. Please give our webstore a look if you are interested!

## Gencon 2025

[IMAGE]

I observed last year that the experience the team had accrued over many Gencons helped immensely in smoothing out the set-up process for the convention, and this year was even further proof of that. We’ve settled into a well-practiced rhythm, and though the physical demands of setting up an exhibition space that is up to our exacting standards remains the same, having a confident and well-versed roadmap has cleared up a lot of mental bandwidth for the team to just be excited to engage with the fans.

The unprecedented crowds and cheers spilling out from our demo tables was a joy to see from my usual perch next to the booth. Everyone was absolutely amazing this year, and I cannot thank the team enough for making each subsequent Gencon even more successful than the last.

[IMAGE]

## Dazzling Displays

On the topic of thank yous, I wanted to give a big thank you to our lovely fan erichwithanh for collaborating with us to create some absolutely badass new display cases! We take pride in the immense amount of intention we put into all of our displays, and these new cases have allowed us to level up our presentation to a groundbreaking level!

[IMAGE]

## A Bounty of Gifts

The opportunity to share in the joy of Kingdom Death and speak in-person with the fans is already a privilege that is hard to articulate with words alone, yet our fans continue to go above and beyond with their gracious generosity. The team and I were presented with all manner of wonderful gifts throughout the convention, and I'd like to express my gratitude for each and every one!

Though there’s not nearly enough space to spotlight each individual item we were given, I’ve carved out a space for each item we’ve received. As I walk through the office, looking at all these physical manifestations of love and support, I can’t help but get excited to work on things our fans will continue to love!

## Hand to Hand Combat

I wanted to give particular kudos to a fan who rocked this incredible rendition of the Hand, complete with its signature spine saber. A team member at our event space mentioned after the convention had wrapped that “a Hand cosplayer” ended up attending a showdown event with the Hand. That must have made for quite a peculiar Regal Visit!

[IMAGE]

And he wasn’t the only one who dressed for the occasion. It seems like every year there are more and more wonderful Kingdom Death cosplays that visit us on the exhibit hall floor. Off the cuff, I remember seeing great costumes of Glow, the Female Visionary, and a pair of starting survivors from past conventions that have begun upgrading their gear to include some rawhide armor pieces.

We’ll have to come up with some official goodies for visiting us in KD cosplay next year! 

## Lore with Bra Mithra

Speaking with Bra Mithra (an active member of the community who runs a Youtube channel dedicated to Kingdom Death content) at Gencon has become an annual tradition at this point. One of the many topics we always speak about is the lore and narrative behind the curtains of the game. I must admit that I’ve come to look forward to these conversations exploring the world of Kingdom Death and sharing what’s discovered with the rest of the community.

Bra Mithra always brings his A-game when it comes to asking questions about the setting, but I thought that this year’s slate was particularly insightful! Curious viewers can listen to our discussion here, though be warned that it does contain spoilers for content from Revamped Shipping Wave 1!

## Gencon Painting Contest

Another perennial highlight of the convention is the presence of our fans at the Gencon Painting Contest! I believe this year featured the most Kingdom Death entries we have ever seen at the competition to date! I want to give a special shout-out to the Lantern’s Reign fan discord community, who I heard helped organize painters interested in competing!

[IMAGE]

I’ve included a gallery here of all of the Kingdom Death themed entries we could find from the Contest. A big thank you to our Volunteer of Death Mumford for collating everything!

## Stories from the Team

In many ways, our trips to Gencon are a microcosm of the work we do everyday on this shared passion project. Whether it be manning our booth or creating the next wave of Kickstarter rewards, each individual is integral to the success of the whole. So I thought it would only be fitting to share some snapshots and sentiments from the rest of the team.

[IMAGE]

“It was great interacting with potential new fans and guiding them through the demo! I even had a survivor named after me and he ended up getting very lucky rolls :)” - Josh

[IMAGE]

“During one memorable Cinematic Showdown with the Red Witches, Braal finally had a chance to perform the Legendary card Meteoric Warrior! After she bludgeoned the survivor with a four-card combo, they managed to remain standing with four bleeding tokens. The euphoria was short-lived, as Nico immediately tag-teamed the survivor with her Cruel Bladecraft, leaving our fierce Brawler Armor with no more blood to bleed. The other survivors succumbed shortly after, but they took the moral victory of surviving Braal's hyper-combo finish.”

[IMAGE]

“I loved seeing people bring in painted models that we worked hard on at the lab. It’s satisfying to know the pieces go to people who really appreciate them and do the sculpts justice. That was a highlight for me.”

[IMAGE]

“One of the highlights of Gencon was running the White Lion demos. I thoroughly enjoy seeing how everyone gets so intrigued as I explain the mechanics of the game and inform the Survivors, “You have 4 bleeding tokens and if you get one more hit then that’s it” really ramps up the level of excitement not just for the players but for everyone else that’s watching.”

## Event Space 2025

[IMAGE]

Our event space this year was another roaring success! After testing out the waters last year, we decided to increase our table count this year to four in an effort to ensure that as many fans could experience the events as possible. From what I’ve been told, tickets still managed to sell out almost immediately! 

## Settlements of Death

[IMAGE]

One of the two main types of events players can experience at our event space are the “Settlements of Death”, curated campaigns that pass through the hands of dozens of convention goers from lantern year to lantern year, weaving into a communal narrative over the course of the con.

[IMAGE]

I’ve always loved the sense of grandeur that develops around a survivor or settlement once their story escapes the confines of a personal play session and is shared among the community at large. As if passing from the ordinary into legend. It was this very process that birthed the fan favorite survivor “Crabman” last year. To that end, I would like to relay the fates of this year’s Settlements of Death, Stonehollow and Vimstead.

Stonehollow met its end in true Kingdom Death fashion, with the last four survivors of the settlement squaring off against the Butcher. At the end of a grueling showdown, a lone living survivor dealt the killing blow against the nemesis before bleeding out themselves.

After the last dice of the weekend were rolled, Vimstead was left with…seven survivors! Their names are recorded here for posterity: Kanazawa, Nichobolas, Ixel, Faith, Seedless Darkness, Belief, and Savior. Though I’m not certain what’s next for Vimstead, I know we’re not quite finished with this settlement’s story yet!

## Volunteers of Death 2025

[IMAGE]

A hearty round of thank yous to this year’s volunteers for helping the team make playing Kingdom Death an unforgettable experience for so many! The team had nothing but glowing endorsements for everyone’s hard work.

Kingdom Death is a more complex game than much of what is available on the show floor, and that is reflected in the work that goes into running our events. I’m only able to have full confidence in the quality of our event space because I know that our volunteers are the best in the industry, bar none. Thank you all again for dedicating your time and passion towards KD!

## I LOVE DIS BEE (PREVIEW)!!!!!!!!!!!!

[IMAGE]

Finally, we unveiled a reveal I’ve been sitting on for a looooooong time. This year’s future content preview was the Titan Bee, and it generated quite a bit of buzz! Bra Mithra stopped by while the event was happening and managed to snag a video of the showdown in progress, which you can check out here!

## Revamped Shipping Wave 1 Fulfillment

[IMAGE]

Much of our month back from the con has been dedicated to ensuring a smooth fulfillment for everyone’s Revamped Shipping Wave 1 rewards, and I am happy to report that the majority of US, Canada, Australia, Asia, South America, and RoW shipments are now fulfilled!

Unfortunately, due to transit delays in Europe and the UK, fulfillment in these regions have only begun in earnest this week. A good number of European backers should have received their tracking already, and we expect many more to do so by next week as more inventory makes its way to our warehouses.

We have all hands on deck working through the delays with the hope that we will be able to wrap fulfillment and have rewards in the hands of all backers before the end of next month. We can’t wait for everyone to experience the lunacy this wave of content has to offer firsthand!

Once fulfillment has wrapped, we will shift the focus of our updates towards the next revamped shipping wave.

## Dark Treasury Update

[IMAGE]

For users of the Dark Treasury, rollout for this wave’s content is ongoing. Due to aforementioned transit delays, EU and UK backers may experience some slight hold-ups. Dark Treasury users from all other regions should receive prompt fulfillment service.

In addition, White Speaker - Blood Mage is now available for fulfillment from the Dark Treasury for those who participated in our Preorder Test!

## Community Garden

Q: What send are in the revamped wave 1?

A: Revamped Shipping Wave 1 rewards include: Red Witches Expansion, Pariah Expansion, Wanderer Goth, Aeneas, Death Drifter, Candy &amp; Cola, False Messengers, Gatherism, and Percival.

Q: Will you include at some point the node cards for all new expansions?? Or do we need to wait until CoD 2 to have those cards?? Or will they be included on the big campaign expansions like inverted mountain, silver city and so on?

A: We’re currently looking at a few different approaches to providing Node cards for newer entries to the Expansions of Death. The two likeliest solutions at the moment are either to provide them alongside the release of CoD Vol. 1 with the rest of the earlier expansions, or in a dedicated card pack.

Q: When can we expect to see Kingdom Death Build guides to be updated? Is there any reasoning as to why the build guides are not always present?

A: We try to update build guides as each major wave of hard plastic content becomes available to the public. Due to the fact that the build guides are the work of one very dedicated team member, delays may occur in their release cycle if they take leave, have other work on their docket, etc.

Q: Will the original beta users for dark treasury keep their access to it for the next waves or do we have to sign up again ?

A: Signing up for the Dark Treasury is a one-time process. Once your Account of Death is connected to your pledge, you will continue to have access for the rest of your rewards.

Q: What about being able to run it without a cloud resource? While I hope this day never comes, what if Adam Poots Games ever ceased operations? At least the hardcopy game is always usable, but as a Master Key owner i would be interested in being able to hedge against losing the SIM by shelf hosting should it ever be needed.

A: Unfortunately, we are unable to offer an offline version of the KDS at this time. Should a time ever arrive that continued support for KDS is no longer possible, I will discuss possible solutions for preserving access for existing users with the dev team.

Q: I just got the Gatherism. The back of Philosophi card is different with the others. Anyone get the same issue or just me? Can I claim it?

A: Unfortunately, we do not have suitable replacements for discolored card backs at this time. Color consistency remains a field we strive to improve upon. The issue has been made known to our manufacturing partners and we’ve added additional steps to our QA process to prevent similar issues from arising in the future.

Q: is the printed stuff from the messengers of death being made avalable to the returning backers from the first Kickstarter? I remember it talked about but have not heard anything in a while.

A: Yep! Game content from the False Messengers will be available in a future card pack. 

Q: @poots do you have any plans to make the harvester a monster you can fight? Which node will it be??

A: Not at the moment, no!
