Happy Valentines day!

[IMAGE]

We have opened the pledge manager up to the first batch of 1,000 people! Invites will be sent out shortly! Provided everything is looking good, we will continue to invite more backers everyday!

We have started to collect email address for Late Backers. We will invite late backers into the fray after all the backers are settled. 
As of writing this, I am planning on keeping the pledge manager open for a month. If there is anything you missed, now is the ideal time adjust your pledge! Depending on how long it takes to get everyone invited and whatever bugs come up might effect how long I keep the pledge manager open.

Man Hunter Pinups!

I have not forgotten! We just didn’t quite make it in time during the campaign. Here is the female incarnation and I am happy to report that Hamlet Machine is working on the male version!

You can add these to your pledge via the pledge manager.
Pinups of Death, 3, 4 and 5I have decided to create 3 new collections based on the pinups we kickstarted together. Pledge levels that have all the “new” pinups, will be getting all 3 of these collections. The collections will include lux packaging, large art prints of each pinup and a tiny bit of game content that I am still working on. (Very much like our original Pinups of Death, which includes the Strange Spot Settlement event and Belt of Gender Swap).
Pinups as single releases will include a character card, simple packaging and of course the miniature!
Fulfillment services charge per “pick” when they are packing an order. So if you had 27 pinups in your order, they would charge you +$27 on top of the shipping label fee! By making collections we greatly reduce the number of picks and make shipping much cheaper for you guys. To incentivize you more, there is also a bit of savings for grabbing a collection vs getting the pinups a la carte. Like $15-$30 off depending on the model count in the collection.
Ah, just because I Know someone will ask, pledge levels that are getting all the “new” pinups cannot opt to have all the pinups as single releases instead of the collections. Sorry, thats pure madness and it will make my head explode. Seriously. If this is a deal breaker for you, let me know. But I am still not going to change it! Were about to deal with around 20,000 backers and I have to be inflexible here and there. I extend my personal apologies for whatever unique exception you might have. 
Progress! Last month has been all about 1.5. Copy editors, final play testing, tweaking, minor turning of knobs here and there. It’s been fun and now that we are on the edge of the print deadline it’s gotten a bit hectic! 
The game has gotten slightly easier in some places, giving players more room for play variety. Survival of the Fittest being viable and not just for the crazed (me) has produced some very cool player data! The Nerf to the Saviors was really needed, too many campaigns ended with a handful of them just blasting everything apart. Which removes the tension and strategy even if it was fun to Slam Dunk the Watcher. 

Saviors live much longer now and as you use their unique power, they age. It’s proven to be more fun, as their abilities are handy in a pinch! However, they are far less powerful, cannot be ageless and a settlement can only have 1 at a time.
We had a play testing group that was playing with shared wisdom incorrectly, but we really liked how it turned out! Now all you need is Language to benefit from the locations new special rule. Meaning you can spend endeavors to give noob survivors hunt xp as early as Lantern Year 1. The change feels great and is a nice alternative to just playing with guts.

Thomas David has started to sculpt the Oblivion Mosquito! Here are some are some early photos from his work bench:

Otherwise the sculpting team has been mostly focusing on pinups, as they are easier for me to direct while putting the other 95% of my time into meeting the 1.5 print deadline. Here is a quick render of the Pinup Pond Scum Armor, with some water effects!

Here is a little teaser of a story event you can trigger during the Showdown with the Gold Smoke Knight!

Armor Kit Painting Contest
We have a few outstanding corrections we need to make, don’t worry this has not been forgotten! Just sorta put on the back burner while we get 1.5 off to the printer.

Sale

We are also launching our Valentines day sale on our web store. If you are interested in some of our resin miniatures please have a look! Thanks!
