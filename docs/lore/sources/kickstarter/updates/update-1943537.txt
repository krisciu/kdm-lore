I have delayed the production of Kingdom Death: Monster 1.5 to make the following changes:

- The Showdown board is now shrink wrapped.

- The Monster Control Panel is now packed within the folded Showdown board.

- Shipping box upgraded to Heavy Duty Triple Ply.

- Shipping box includes foam around the edges of the game.

Estimated fulfillment date is now end of September / Early October. 
(Originally end of August.)

I had talked about rolling delays due to the sheer size of our campaign back in Update 35. 

"Shipping Delays 
Due to the size of our campaign and the staggering amount of content presented. There is a very real possibility we will see delays to the estimated shipping dates. Right now, it’s looking like everything will be pushed back 1-3 months. I won’t know until the campaign has ended and pledges are confirmed, so I know how many more core games we need to produce! (Don’t worry the ball is already rolling on this, but I do need to manage expectations.)"

The choice to shrink wrap every game board was mine and thus the delay is 100% on me. If your at Gencon this week, come by to talk to me directly!

We will be at gencon booth #3003. In the same dark corner we were at last year. We'll have some copies of KD 1.5 and the Update pack on display, so please come on by and check it out!

We will also have many miniature prototypes on display and a sort of challenge-demo with a level 3 Dung Beetle Knight that kills you before you can really see any of the new 1.5 stuff!

KDM 1.5 Pre-Orders - 25% off Retail

We will be accepting pre-orders for Kingdom Death Monster 1.5 at our booth at a discounted rate. These orders will be shipped directly following backer fulfillment.

Last Copies of KDM

We scrounged every warehouse and have collected our very last  of the Kingdom Death: Monster inventory. We will be selling these at full price during the show. When you buy it, we'll take down some information from you because... we'll be sending you the 1.5 upgrade pack for free! (These will ship with pre-orders.)

Anyways, come by our booth and check us out!

Painting Contest 

Ah yes, honestly I've just been too busy to make the final announcements and award the winners! Ack! Don't worry we've hired someone to help me with community endeavors in the future. We will announce the winners and maybe even set up a new contest after we return from gencon.
