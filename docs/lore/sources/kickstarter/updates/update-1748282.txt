We have now surpassed the original kickstarter by more then twice. Does this mean we have gone Super Sayian 2? Is that powerful enough to blow up a planet? 

So many deep thoughts. Or perhaps I stopped making any sense a few hours ago.

Satan's Lantern Pledge Levels

Lot's of questions regarding what this level includes. What I posted in the comment section is wrong (sorry!) I can't include crossover miniatures in this bundle as I am not the only IP holder for them. Here is exactly whats included:

Kingdom Death: Monster core game 1.5 edition
Gambler’s Chest packed with some much TBD!!! 

 All pinup miniatures revealed during this campaign. 
 All promo miniatures revealed during this campaign. 
 All expansions revealed during this campaign. 
 Satan Tshirt (design TBD) 
 Pinups of Death Series 1 (show me)

All 12 current Kingdom Death: Monster expansions:
Flower Knight Expansion,  Dragon King Expansion,  Manhunter Expansion,  Gorm Expansion,  Lion Knight Expansion,  Dung Beetle Knight Expansion,  Spidicules Expansion,  Sunstalker Expansion 
Lion God Expansion,  Slenderman Expansion ,Lonely Tree Expansion,  Green Knight Expansion

All Pinups &amp; Promos from last kickstarter in high-quality hard plastic: 
 Anna &amp; Adam Explorers of Death KS Exclusive,  Pinup Dragon Sacrifice,  Pinup Lantern Festival.  Pinup Leather Queen,  Pinup Lioness,  Pinup Phoenix Dancer,  Pinup Primal Huntress,  Pinup Rawhide Dame,  Pinup Regeneration Suit,  Pinup Silk Assassin w/ unique base Insert,  Pinup Sunstalker Dancer,  Pinup Twilight Witch,  Pinup Reversal, Allison The Twilight Knight (yes the new one in the shiny white box).

Messenger of Courage w/ unique insert,  Messenger of Humanity w/ unique insert,  Messenger of the First Story,  Messenger of the Spiral Path,  Holiday White Speaker Nico,  Beyond the Wall (yes the new version in the shiny white box).

This does not include any gifts or the Survivor Level reward. These were neither promos or pinups. This also excludes crossover miniatures as I am not the IP holder of these figures.

Here are some things that shouldn't be included, because they are not Pinups or Promos that I am throwing in anyway:

- Aya the Survivor
- Paul the Survivor 
- Twilight Knight 
- Snow the Savior

1.5 Changelog Reveal

The Core Game Book has been upgraded to a hard cover book! It will also include one of those super neat cloth bookmarks! This is for both the 1.5 Core game and the 1.5 Update Pack!
