March 1st we will begin charging shipping fees for backers receiving Wave 2 expansions. You must ensure your shipping address and payment method are up to date in backerkit.

If your address and payment method are up-to-date you don't need to do anything. Please look forward to future shipping details for your Wave 2 items.

If your items are shipped to the wrong address we must charge additional shipping fees to resend your items. No exceptions.

I understand that Late Backers that do not follow kickstarter updates may have missed our previous message, we are messaging them via the email they provided on backerkit and will give them time to complete any payment and address updates before shipping their rewards.

If there are any issues, please reach out to us at kingdomdeath.com/support 

If you are charged the incorrect amount via backerkit, we will resolve the issue. We are working closely with backerkit to ensure wave 2 is as smooth as possible.

Note: We CANNOT offer support via kickstarter, there is no way to track messages and it becomes to difficult to help people quickly. Do not expect someone to reply if you describe your issue in the comment section or via the kickstarter message section. Reach out to us directly and we will take care of your issue.

Thank you very much!!!!!
