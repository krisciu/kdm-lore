Take me to the World of SMOG!

KD:M 1.5 Pledge Manager - Estimated Feb 14!

We are aiming to launch the pledge manager on feburary 14th 2017, aka Valentines day! I can confirm that we will be using backerkit and that there is sooo much we need to ensure works properly. Lot's of work! We are trying to build in as many accommodations as we can for the various requests we've received in the past few weeks. Please allow us the time to get everything prepared and the understanding that we must remain tight-lipped about its details until it is launched.

Armor Kit Painting Contest!

Our Amor Kit Painting contest was amazing, we had a HUGE turnout! It was inspirational to see so many new hobbyists jump into the action! There are a few submissions that we could not approve due to blurry photos and such, I will reach out to those people so they have the chance to resubmit and be added to our gallery.

We will announce the winners in due time. Now it's time for JUDGEMENT! BWA HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!

Check out the full gallery here!!!

I am publishing them as of right now! There are over 100 entries and I need to set the thumbnail and name for each, so give it a few hours before everything is fully published!

One big take away we have from this contest, and one I was not really expecting. Kingdom Death has attracted a lot of new hobbyists to the world of miniature building and painting. Which is amazing and now something I think we (as a company) need to take steps to properly support. 

Work in Progress

Here are some WIP shots of the many sculptures we are working on! Next update I should have some approvals form Paizo and can show off the Pathfinders of Death, along with whatever else we have looking good by then!

Update Frequency &amp; Expectation Management

Please do not or scheduled updates from myself or the KD:M team. I like to write the updates myself, as I can share my unique perceptive with everyone and it feels good to communicate directly. However, since there is just SO MUCH going on everyday, it's not something I feel comfortable making a scheduled thing. I need to be excited to share and ready to talk about the status of the project or any small part of the project. There is a shocking amount to consider each time I write an update.

My plan is to continue doing the best I can and reaching out to you amazing people whenever we really have something to communicate or show. Otherwise, my attention is day by day focused on the myriad of tasks at hand. 

First one up. Getting all those last minute typo's and adjustments into the 1.5 Core Game, which I need to 100% sign off on by Feb 8th. Gonna be some loooong hours in the fistful of days! If we make it in time, it gives us our BEST chance of having it within our original estimate. However, I would expect that 3 month rolling delay I mentioned during the campaign. Manufacturing requires a lot of attention and I can't in good faith approve of something subpar just to make a deadline.

Any requests for what we wanna see / talk about next time!?!!!!!!!!
