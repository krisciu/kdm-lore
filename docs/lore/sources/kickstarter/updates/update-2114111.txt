Wave 2 - Estimated March 7th

Wave 2 fulfillment is estimated to begin March 7th. Some regions may ship a little sooner or later than that. Please ensure your backerkit address and method of payment are up to date as we will start charging for wave 2 shipping March 1st.

Wave 2 includes: Dragon King Expansion, Dung Beetle Knight Expansion, Flower Knight Expansion, Gorm Expansion, Green Knight Expansion, Lion God Expansion, Lion Knight Expansion, Lonely Tree Expansion, Manhunter Expansion, Slenderman Expansion, Spidicules Expansion, Sunstalker Expansion

Backers in the Asia Region 
We will be shipping your Wave 2 rewards first. In light of this, please ensure your payment method and shipping address are up to date in backerkit ASAP.

Wave 2 Shipping Costs
We are eating the shipping costs and providing everyone with the absolute lowest rate we can. It’s the same as our estimate, but consider every expansion beyond the first on us! (In a lot of cases this is 50% off, since the majority of you got EVERY expansion!) Similar to what we did with our first kickstarter, we are splitting the cost of shipping these expansions with backers!

Oblivion Mosquito Hard Plastic
We got the first production sample of this massive and beautiful insect just in time for our update! Everything is pretty spectacular, except the detail loss on the large lower face. The factory agrees and revisions will follow.

Black Knight Squires

We’ve been working on the 5 year Squires Campaign that comes with the Black Knight expansion. Here are some renders of the unique group you’ll be playing, including the Weapon Smith that repairs the sleeping Black Knights Armor!

Female First Hero

If you want to campaign skip to Lantern Year 20, it'll be the female first hero you'll face! I decided to make her the stronger of the pair.

Pinup Mountain Dungeon Armor

I love Lokman’s character design for the Pinup Mountain Dungeon Armor. However, once we sculpted her… it came to our attention that all of the flowing fabric was distracting from her anatomy and actually reducing the feeling of vertigo we were going for!

The sculpting team and I worked on another version, bringing it back to bare anatomy which we thought would showcase the vertical feeling in a different way. Unable to decide which to declare a final, I’ve decided to put BOTH versions in Pinups of Death 4!

Happy Valentine's Day!
I hope everyone has a wonderful, silly holiday. Do something you love, like play Kingdom Death! We have launched a Valentine's Day sale on our web store, feel free to check it out.

And a Happy Valentine's Day from Lokman!!!
