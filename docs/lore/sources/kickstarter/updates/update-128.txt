Running this project has filled me with immense gratitude over the years. Weathering scope creep, delays, more scope creep, and a good dose of global disasters has not always been easy. But the choice to delay, to grind development to a halt, and to double, triple and quadruple down on the quality of what we make has been my choice and my choice alone.

Now we are faced with another challenge, tariffs and uncertainty affecting production, world-wide freight, and package shipping. TODAY I HAVE DECIDED TO TAKE STEPS TO SHIELD BACKERS FROM PRICE INCREASES BY LEANING INTO THE CHAOS AND WIELDING THE INSPIRATION THAT CHAOS CREATES.

You supported me. You allowed me to create what we have created, to chase my wild ambitions, and to work with a huge assortment of talented people. And here is how I will be backing that up:

I am stepping up by investing my personal savings and a chunk of savings from the business to create a barrier to shield the project and the incredible team that helps me create it. 

This is our blood barrier.

There is chaos at the ports, tons of conflicting information, and fluctuating circumstances greet us every morning! Hell, this whole tariffs situation might all change between the time I am writing this and the time it gets posted!

So long as the trade war directly affects us, during our monthly webstore sales - I will introduce Luxury products we make here in NYC and overcharge for them. Profit from these items will be added to the BLOOD BARRIER which will be used to pay tariff bills and offset the skyrocketing cost of materials.

SO IF YOUR FEELING SPICY, FEEL FREE TO EMBRACE THE CHAOS WITH ME!

## Boutique Prices

We are increasing our webstore prices in general. 

Honestly, I should have made changes to keep up with the rising costs of every aspect of miniature production. Kingdom Death is a boutique brand, we have increased our spend over the years to remain boutique, hand stamped, engineered, scrutinized, and packed by a remarkable dedicated team of people that have been at the studio working hard through every curveball the world throws at us.

The price changes will go into effect towards the end of May. THESE CHANGES DO NOT AFFECT ANY KICKSTARTER CONTENT YOU HAVE PLEDGED FOR.

## Fulfillment

It’s a weird update - So I will not be sharing the glamorous photos of our upcoming shipping wave (estimated to be completed by the factory mid may). Instead, I'll be shamelessly posting images of what’s currently available in our webstore for our Easter Sale!

Our partner factory has estimated that printing for the Remastered Wave 1 items will be complete by mid may! Until I have some sense of what our final tariff hit will be, I won’t be putting these items up for preorder - but that will not delay fulfillment to you backers. Chaos at the ports? Shipping lane collapse? Factory struggles? Who knows. Revisions may need to happen but the plan as far as we know right now is to keep moving ahead shipping remastered wave 1 when production wraps.

If anything we are trying to take advantage of the moment (as many other studios and companies are pausing or canceling their productions) and SPEED things up.

So once again, thank you.

Hopefully this will earn me some good boy points when we push the Kingdom Death: Simulator into crowdfunding this Black Friday!

Q: Is Wave 2 Percival a new or updated expansion/mini? Can we add it to our pledge?

A: Percival was originally a single release model with game rules available via our webstore, and was included in a few select pledge levels such as the “Percival’s Lantern”. If you do not have the Percival single release as part of your pledge, it will also be available via our webstore after it has been fulfilled for backers who pledged for the content.

Q: @poots do you have any plans to begin producción now that usa has halted tariffs for at least 90 days??

A: I covered this a bit already, but the situation is changing so quickly and so constantly that it would be difficult to make a production decision based solely on the latest tariffs information released. 

Still, I AM pushing ahead with production as we continue to explore different strategies for how to get content and pledge rewards into everyone’s hands as soon as possible. We’re gonna embrace the chaos!

Q: A few game companies are doing some small content packs sort of as a "fundraiser" to help cover the tariff costs for in production KS projects.

Any thoughts on maybe doing something similar? Something like an Alternate Art card pack would be perfect. No new content, but cool alt art cards so that those who can afford it can help offset the rising costs.

A: I’ve been brainstorming all sorts of products we can add to our webstore with truly LEGENDARY price tags to help augment our tariffs blood barrier. If they interest you, we'd love your support!

Q: Ignoring the issues on tariffs, for the moment, ( I love this game and will cough up the required extra cash to get all the new and amazing content I can.) I have a couple of game related questions. One, what tier is the gatherism philosophy? Secondly what node is the Verdant lord? Fanale or core? Lastly, is there an eta for the gamblers chest in the simulator? Thanks, and keep making great content.

A: Sure! 

1. Gatherism is a Tier 2 philosophy. 

2. Verdant Lord is a Finale monster. 

3. The devs have been giving it 110% getting everything polished for primetime, but I don’t have a solid date just yet.

Q: So I gotta ask with CoD approaching.- any plans for a "Boss Rush" mode?

A: Even more “bosses” than there already are in a normal campaign? …Maybe!

Q: Question for poots, now that usa has a 245% tariff will it be better to send everytjing to canada and ship from there?? Or will it also be hit by the tariffs even if it comes from another country??

A: Unfortunately, tariffs are not determined by where a product is shipped from, but where the product was manufactured. Rearranging shipping routes would not prevent tariff charges, just add on even more shipping costs to everything!

Q: Is Dead Armour the new name for Death Armor Expansion or is it a different product, I still have Death Armor Expansion outstanding.

A: Yep! We found the name tweak helped differentiate the armor from the “Deathking Armor”.

Q: Second class backer from Europe here: why do we have to pay 100% of VAT and for the US backers you try to shoulder 50%?

A: VAT was officially adopted by the EU in 1977. It is not part of a current "trade war". We have made many efforts to partner with warehouses across the world, to minimize shipping costs where taxes are high. I hope that you see and appreciate that we continue to explore solutions for backer concerns across the world. You are not 2nd class backers and we value your support. Thank you!

Q: Hey Adam, if you're taking Q&amp;A questions for the upcoming update. Can you give us the update for where the Ivory Dragon pitch currently is at? Like, what things in it, currently, and so on?

A: Sorry, no spoilers just yet! I’ll revisit this once active development pivots towards the expansion after we wrap up Inverted Mountain/Abyssal Woods.
