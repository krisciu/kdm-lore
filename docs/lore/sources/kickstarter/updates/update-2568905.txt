I am delaying wave 3 projects by a year.

I have yet to reach satisfaction and I must continue development. I need the Gambler's Chest and Campaigns of Death to receive the benefits of my full power. 

With deep appreciation of the everyone’s collective excitement, I am sorry. 

This experience continues to be outrageously humbling. In respect to you, the team, Kingdom Death and myself, my only choice is to continue to refine and polish wave 3 content. So that I can bring you my best and nothing less.

I know waiting is difficult.

Thank you in advance.

...

## The Gambler's Chest is now The Gambler's Chest Expansion

Originally a bonus bonanza box of small pieces of gameplay, as it was being developed the content began to coalesce. Forming its own bizarre and beautiful experience. I felt an opportunity to make something really special and well… have decided to go for it!

The Gambler's Chest content weaves together in a new 30 year campaign where players can experience the story of the cognitively advanced survivors living in the shadow of the Gambler (known to them as the Dream Keeper)!

## Tooling on the hard plastic Gambler is finished! 

Its molds were milled on a high-end 5-axis CNC machine. I wanted to bring every detail to the highest point of clarity possible, so that everyone could enjoy this masterpiece as close to the physically sculpted original as humanly possible. I spared no expensive, even personally investing my own money into the purchase of this machine for the factory.

## Crimson Crocodile

The Crimson Crocodile is a node 1 quarry monster that is included in the Gambler’s Chest Expansion. We teased it during out last update. In the campaign, it replaces the White Lion and is the first monster survivors encounter. It will of course, also include a settlement location and armor set. And yes, its much more difficult than the White Lion. Good luck getting out of the prologue!

[IMAGE]

[IMAGE]

## Atnas The Child Eater 

[IMAGE]

I had to travel deep into Kingdom Death to understand what Atnas was all about. It was when I realized Atnas was an uncrowned king of a forgotten age, creator of the lord of storms and the storm knights, master swordsman, ancient and emotionally deranged, searching only for what sparks joy so for a brief moment, it can recall its sword craft…

… then it all finally came together!

[IMAGE]

[IMAGE]

Here I thought creating an evil Santa would be fun and easy! Nothing in the history of Kingdom Death has gone thru more creative revisions, ranging from conceptual, sculptural and place in the world. Maybe in the future I'll show off what hit the cutting room floor. For now its a mystery!

Oh! And while I am here I might as well share some Atnas Strory Event Artwork!

[IMAGE]

Oh! Oh! We finished the engineering and Atnas might make it in time to see in person at our Booth 3003, at Gencon 2019!

[IMAGE]

## Philosophy System

So let's talk about this system and um how maybe it changed a tiny bit?

[IMAGE]

So the asset count is now 5-6 times what I had originally planned. With each philosophy level having its own artwork and corresponding page detailing what happens to a survivor as their outlook evolves along with the crazy ways these outlooks clash and interact with the settlement as a whole.

When a survivor with a Philosophy returns from a hunt, they are inspired and their philosophy rank increases. Turn to the corresponding page of their Philosophy book. Typically, a philosophy has 5 ranks with the 5th being gated behind requirements the settlement needs to reach.

There is only so far a survivors experience will take their unique perspective, so while a survivor can still earn the benefits of age and weapon proficiency, their outlook will be set and will only increase by so much.

Progressing thru the ranks of a philosophy will not only change the survivor, but any knowledge cards they earn are added to the settlements collective knowledge deck.

## Scout System

The life of a scout is harsh. They travel with the hunting party with a massive, debilitating pack. Enabling and supporting the hunting survivors in their precarious, thankless tasks. At best they’ll manage to avoid getting killed and gain a little insight from watching the showdown from a hiding spot. At worst they’ll watch everyone die and have the grim task of waiting a monster out in order to salvage precious gear and what's left of their fellow survivors' corpses before all of it is lost to the darkness forever.

[IMAGE]

A settlement does not have a set Scout, they decide what survivors will fill that grim role each year. Gear befitting of their macabre purpose can be crafted at the Outskirts settlement location. 

Survivors typically don’t last long as Scouts but their perspective and insights can be invaluable to the settlement. Leading to new knowledge cards and pattern cards!

[IMAGE]

## Pattern Cards?!

That’s right! You did just read that!

[IMAGE]

[IMAGE]

[IMAGE]

[IMAGE]

The full rules for the Strain System and building sequential campaigns within your Death World will be included in Campaigns of Death. The Gambler’s Chest Expansion will include a less in depth version of the rules that will still allow you to utilize the content, just not quite in the same significant way.

## Encounter System

Here is just a little taste of what's to come. I am planning on an Encounter System focused update towards the end of September that shows much more!

[IMAGE]

The other Encounter monster included in the Gambler's Chest Expansion is... 

[IMAGE]

Smog Stalkers play a very important part of eco system. As they convert dangerous atmosphere into clean oxygen for our Survivors and many other monsters to enjoy!

Anyway, more details and the Encounter Systems long revision journey will be revealed for the end of September kickstarter update!

## God Hand

The Hand descends upon the settlement at full power. No longer imitating the style of the Singing Mantis Shrimp and instead showcasing its own swordplay.

The new miniature of course, is now included in the Gambler’s Chest Expansion.

[IMAGE]

God Hand replaces the Gold Smoke Knight at the end of the Gambler’s Chest campaign and if you could guess, its a way harder fight! (And yes it will have God Sized AI cards!)

Oh! And engineering on this model is complete! 

## Nightmare Adam

Thanks for the chance to be insanely embarassed working on a sculpture. In all honesty I kept delaying work on this because it’s really hard to work on a miniature of yourself. I guess I really gotta stick to that diet and hit the gym. Perhaps it would feel less awkward! 

[IMAGE]

This still needs a little bit of work, but I wanted to at least show where its at.

Overall the adjustments to the Gamblers Chest look like this:

  - + 30 Year Campaign.

  - + Godhand - Final Encounter

  - + Philosophy System evolving from cards to books.

  - + Pattern Cards.

  - + Crimson Crocodile - Node 1 Quarry (This was added last Black Friday).

  - Gambler - Core Monster (like the Watcher).

  - Atnas - Node 2 Nemesis.

## Campaigns of Death

First, let's take a look at the final hard plastic version of the Ancient Butcher!

[IMAGE]

The Ancient Butcher can be used as a core monster (like the watcher) or a finale monster (like the Gold Smoke Knight). That's a 100mm base its standing on! 

As much as I love the Ancient Butcher, it was sort of a hard stretch to imagine it supporting 5 new campaigns by itself. In order for the Strain System to truly shine, there needed to be more to experience then just mixtures of the existing expansions + the Ancient Butcher.

So I opened the door and spent some time in Kingdom Death, creatively wondering and wandering about where survivors might settle and what might happen to them if they were involved in different monsters eco systems beyond just the watcher.

I went back to this content and decided to take few items that were planned for separate future release and integrate them into the overall package. This meant going back to the drawing board on some of the proposed campaigns and really refining what they were about. As it was, the campaigns with the Ancient Butcher felt great, but the others were lacking that new challenge to really bring the story that you experience together.

Here are the 5 campaigns:

People of the Blighted Valley - 30 Year Campaign

A campaign about survivors that settle inside of a Giant Resin Dung Ball, the Beetle Baron’s castle.

People of the Mirrorstone - 30 Year Campaign

A campaign about survivors that find a polished mirror stone and a pile of lantern trophies, instead of a lantern hoard. Little do they know, this is where the Ancient Butcher sharpens its cleavers.

Ballad of the Green Knight - 30 Year Campaign

A campaign that culminates in the Final Encounter with the Verdant Lord, the settlements only hope is to build The Green Knight armor and it's scared blade.

Grindhouse - 5 Year Campaign

A short campaign about barbaric survivors that awaken with red ink, instead of black.

People of the Gloom - 5 Year Campaign

A short campaign about a group of survivors that worship the Slenderman.

Here is what’s been added to support these campaigns and how they further expand the range of campaigns you can generate with the Strain System.

Beetle Baron, as core or finale encounter monster.

[IMAGE]

Verdant Lord, final encounter monster.

[IMAGE]

Infant Sunstalker, allows you to hunt a weaker sunstalker as a node 2 quarry!

[IMAGE]

We also snuck in the Sunstalker Caretakers, no rules here just models to collect!

* Sunstalker Ninja Remastered (originally slatted for separate release)

People of the Stars - Intimacy Couple

[IMAGE]

Vocal Spidicules, a core monster unlock able via the strain system! 

[IMAGE]

There is also word of a Devil Slenderman, but I can't remember any details about it or what it might look like. Weird!

Campaigns of Death has bloomed and now feels complete to me! With new monsters for the stories to circulate around and challenges to work towards overcoming. With strains unlocking and modifying the creation of future campaigns as you go. This is the experience and the full extent of the platform I have envisioned.

Oh! During office play testing we accidentally fed an activated nuclear psyche to a Screaming Antelope. So you can fully expect a Nukealope Vignette with related strain card(s) as a separate release in the future! 

## Pinups of Death 3 - 5

Here are some better shots of the hard plastic pinup Forsaker.

[IMAGE]

+3 Pinups have now been added to the Pinup collections! 

Pinup Male Visionary!!!

[IMAGE]

Pinup Titan Bee Armor!!!!

[IMAGE]

54mm Scale Pinup Screaming God Armor. This sculpture is just so amazing. I cannot resist the urge to tool a larger version of it up too! Bwahahaha!!!!!

[IMAGE]

## Wave 4 

Release TBA. Estimate 2021.

Expect more information in the Black Friday Update regarding the progress of Wave 4 projects. But before then, how bout a little love from dis bee?

[IMAGE]

## Pathfinders of Death

Oh! And we finished the hard plastic version of these mighty warriors!

[IMAGE]

[IMAGE]

## Hard Plastic Satan

[IMAGE]

## The Ever So Charming Spiral Knight!

[IMAGE]

! I will happily continue to share progess on Wave 4 over the next year. However my initial, 100% and sole work purpose in life will be to finish bringing out the best of Wave 3 and getting it out of the door! And into production and onto a boat and into a package and THEN INTO YOUR HOME OR DUSTY KINGDOM DEATH SHRINE BECAUSE IVE MADE YOU WAIT TO LONG AND IM SORRY BUT I GOTTA DO IT RIGHT!!!

## Things that have honestly taken some of my time away from the kickstarter projects.

It’s been a long wait. I know everyone is excited and towards that excitement I do very sincerely apologize. My workflow often has explosive productivity, followed by a long gestation period wherein I work on something else and let earlier progress sit. Often returning to it with fresh eyes allows me to really pinpoint weak points and wrap things up.

## 2D Game Video

Once a week I check in with the 2D game team! We have very slowly been making steady progress on this very VERY back burner passion project. DO not expect it or to hear anything more about it for quite some time!

[IMAGE]

## Owl Monster

We worked on a cool Owl monster, a part of the one day Ring Tail Fox campaign. I know I should have focused on Kickstarter projects but I couldn't help myself. Development has been paused for the time being, but here is a little sneak peak.

## Black Cat

We worked on our first 1/8th scale sculpture! No idea when or if we'll get to release it. Smaller model shown for scale.

[IMAGE]

## Resin Casting Lab

Our master mold maker and resin caster… is retiring! However, instead of simply packing up shop they have decided to pass the torch of knowledge onto us. It’s a honor and I am more then flattered, (maybe a bit flabbergasted too!) and we have been training (yes even me!) to preserve the artform so we can carry on the legacy of casting by hand.

&lt;Sorry I am under agreement with our mentor and master mold maker, wherein I cannot share any photos at this time!&gt;

## Office

Another surprisingly time-consuming project has been expanding our office space. Currently we all work, pretty much crushed elbow to elbow in a single space. And, over what has seemed like an absurd amount of time, we managed to secure the bottom floor of the space next to us and are finally expanding.

[IMAGE]

I am going to have my own office, wherein I can close my door! Can you imagine it! Lol

## Why I Love Kingdom Death

Kingdom Death is my impossible dream, that somehow, with a lot of support and patience from fans and from a tremendous amount of work... came true.  

It has given me the opportunity to look inside and find what excitements me no matter how insane it is. And then work towards it like crazy. Last year was a hard year for me and I lost my way a little. The sheer size of the company and its many small responsibilities started to get the better of me.  

I've started to restructure the company and hire people that can help take over the towering pile of small responsibilities. Because It's time for me to return to what I do best, chasing the impossible dream. Creating content that exceeds everyone's expectations.

Yes I have delayed everything by a year. And yes, I will bring you my best. I fully accept the responsibility of the rise in expectations that delay will cause. And If I need to use personal funds to ensure I bring everything I've added in this update, I will do so.

As a physical representation of that choice:

[IMAGE]

[IMAGE]

Thank you for your patience. Thank you for your understanding. Allow me to the time to bring out my absolute best. Thank you.

Now I am going to bed, big day building the Gencon Booth tomorrow. I'll take my laptop and do my best to answer the many questions that I am sure this update will bring!

Goodnight update, goodnight backers, goodnight fans, goodnight bakcers.

Goodnight giant ball of snoring masses.

Goodnight lantern.

Goodnight dreams everywhere.
