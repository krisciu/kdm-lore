## Fulfillment - Revamped Shipping Wave 1

[IMAGE]

OUR GAMBIT TO RUN FULL SPEED AHEAD INTO THE EMBRACE OF CHAOS HAS PAID OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Production on Revamped Shipping Wave 1 is complete. All of the releases in this wave should be loaded onto shipping vessels within the next two days, where they will spend the month of June merrily making their way to our affiliated warehouses for fulfillment. I am immensely proud of the quality of the content we were able to realize for this set of releases, and I cannot wait for you all to experience it firsthand!

Once the wave is sufficiently close to our warehouses, we will follow up with everyone via backerkit and email to finalize delivery details. Get ready to learn some Dark Secrets and get BOOGERED by the Red Witch Trials!!!!!

We estimate Remastered Wave 1 packages to arrive towards the end of July and into August!

Screaming God Expansion Update

Lots of extra TLC with this one. Thankfully it will be wrapped up and sent off to print soon. Miniature production is also finished as 15 pallets of screaming god plastic awaiting their printed material to be ready.

## Core Game Reprint &amp; Preorders

This month over in our webstore, we are testing our new preorder system that works through our Dark Treasury. If you are interested in the White Speaker Bloodmage, now is your chance to pick it up and also help us iron out kinks in the system.

Because next month we are hoping to set-up Preorders for Remastered Wave 1 items to be shipped out following backer fulfillment!

CORE GAME REPRINT!

This is scheduled to be finished the first week of June and we will be air shipping the first batch of units in time for Gencon 2025! I have received many personal emails (how do people find my email so easily?!) from people asking when or how they could get a copy of our humble game. 

## Gencon 2025

As has become tradition, the team and I have been gearing up to make the trip to Indianapolis for our yearly trade show. We cannot wait for the opportunity to showcase some of the content from upcoming shipping waves that we have been working on, and it is always an immense privilege to be able to interact with our community in person.

We will be located at our usual spot in the corner of the exhibit hall. As with last year, we will also be hosting a series of play events in our dedicated event space. If you are in the area, please visit us for some new reveals, exciting Gencon premieres, and a few other surprises!

This year, we will be giving out bonus goodies to anyone wearing a Kingdom Death T-shirt at check out at our booth. LET'S FLOOD THE CONVENTION FLOOR WITH OUR FAVORITE MONSTER CRESTS!!!!!!!!!!!!![IMAGE]

## Kingdom Death: Simulator

My apologies that it has been quiet! The team has been working on a new round of features and polishing off the Gambler's Chest Expansion. We also had some crazy UX bugs regarding the Black Knights 3D showdown board that required taking a few things back to bedrock, but are fixed now. SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT! AHHH!

We can expect:

- A roll out of the rest of the Echoes of Death series, leading into Survivors of Death.

- Red Witch Expansion &amp; Pariah Expansion close to same time physical packages arrive for backer fulfillment.

- A larger Black Friday event, with a Magnifying Glass Heirloom that introduces a search bar feature to quickly find assets in the game room.

- We continue to flirt with a crowd funding push for the sim, but have mixed feelings about it. It would allow us to make MUCH more rapid progress to bring it up to parity with our physical catalogue and the robust features that are expected of a modern game experience. But y'all have been so patient and understanding with me, I don't want to spoil our own redemption arc. Even though it has become standard practice, we have always felt awkward when companies run one crowdfunding into another... into another... into another. But maybe since the SIM is not developing new game content its excusable? I honestly don't know, but I will keep an open and honest line in regards to it.

## Webstore New Releases 

During our... interesting trade war times, I will continue to plug our webstore's new releases. Sculpting for the Kickstarter projects has long been finished, with the team only revisiting miniatures for a final pass before they are turned over to the engineering team and prepared for CNC machining in the solid diamond blocks we tool all Kingdom Death miniatures in. 

An odd advantage of our long winded project, the miniatures benefit from our hard earned experience right until the final moment it goes into tooling.

However, master sculptors must sculpt and so, we have new releases!

If you are expecting the Screaming God Expansion, it includes a hard plastic version of this Illuminated Lady 2, so its certainly on the "do not need list". But if you crave the unmatched detail of resin, we have this lovely photoresin version of her available for you today.

Finally, our blood barrier release this month is the art print of the Illuminated Lady 2!

Q: What would happen should a Watcher enter a King? And: Can we get that as a vignette, please?

A: That’s a good question! In many ways it would be like the King contracting a virus or infection. I have a pretty good idea of what our next vignette will be, but I could definitely see a Watcher interacting with a King being the crux of a piece of synergy content one day.

Q: I would love to hear more about CoD's Darkness Mode in a future update, and how that works :) Full random!

A: I’m super excited about the system as well! It’s become the favorite way for some of the team to engage with the game.

Q: Please give some details on Death Armour. I would love to know a bit more about it!

A: The Dead Armor has some similarities to the Green Knight Armor in that it is an “ultimate weapon” of sorts. While we will be doing a deep dive of the Green Knight armor with a specific campaign dedicated to it in CoD, the Dead Armor is more versatile in that it can be slotted into any campaign through the use of a pillar card. It’s made of bones, bones, bones, bones, bones, and MORE BONES! If your goal is to build a full Dead Armor set over the course of one campaign, you should expect to commit every bone you’ll ever harvest from lantern year 1 to 30 to the project.

Q: Also how are you going looking through the entries for the expansions painting competition?

A: I have not had a chance to look through the entries of the Expansions of Death Painting Contest myself just yet, but I know our Dark Judges are in the process of reviewing each entry right now! Once I have news on their deliberations, I will share them here.

Q: do you have any plans to begin printing any of the near complete expansions??

A: Yes. If development for a release is complete before the wave it was originally scheduled to be shipped with, we will push its release up so that players are able to get the most content as fast as possible.

Q: could you please give us an overview on which percentage of the cost of an expansion goes to each type of components??

A: This is a tough one, in part because no expansion has the exact same components. For example, the costs of the Black Knight, which contains a full colored set of sizable tiles to represent its citadel, differ greatly from the costs of Spidicules, which features a large amount of hard plastic sprues. In most cases, the highest costs of production generally relate to our use of HIPS for our miniatures, whether it be the costs of tooling or for the production run itself.

Q: it looks like a joke now, but will all the new node 1 monsters flex by killing, maiming or eating the white lion?? Does this mean that the white lion is on the bottom of the food chain for the nd1??

A: It’s a monster eat monster world after all. Perhaps it’s more accurate to say that most node 1 monsters are capable of killing, maiming, or eating each other. For every “Devour the White Lion” story event featuring the Crimson Crocodile, there is a “Devour the Crimson Crocodile” featuring the White Lion stored away in my vaults. 

Q: I don't recall seeing any updates about the super survivors, I think that's the last thing I am missing from the 1.5 KS. Any updates on those models?

A: We are not currently focusing our dev on the Super Survivors, as it is not a part of the next upcoming shipping wave. However, I have blocked out the content structure for the release and it is currently slated to be a similar amount of content to our recent Killennium Butcher vignette.

Q: When will we see the release of Ngama? And will she be an indomitable survivor or a novel proficiency kind of deal seeing as she has 2 different Zambato-like weapons on her sprue?

A: One day!
