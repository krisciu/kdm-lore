And so you have it... the result of the first gambler's roll! I wish I was making the result up, I blame a certain person in the comments section for jinx-ing us! lol

For some reason there is no sound on this video when I preview it from kickstarter. Hopefully this is just a preview thing. And its fine!

Dragon King Expansion - Reprint Confirmed!

I can now officially confirm the Reprint of the Dragon King! Thru this Kickstarter we are offering our most popular expansion at a special pre-production rate. Just because I know people will ask. No, there isn't anything new in this expansion reprint. It is not getting a version update. And Yes, it is included in Satan's Lantern level pledges.

Later tonight I'll make a little menu of our current Add Ons. And I am looking at monday or tuesday to reveal one of the NEW expansions. People will be in the office which will make everything a bit easier.

!!!!!!!!!
