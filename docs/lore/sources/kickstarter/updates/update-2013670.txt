Log in to your Backerkit account, finalize your address, and pay your Wave 1 shipping fee!

Wave 1 Consists of the Following Rewards:
- Kingdom Death: Monster 1.5

- Hardcover 1.5 Core Game Rulebook

USA &amp; South America Fulfillment

Shipments are begining now. The sooner you confirm your address, the sooner I can get your Wave 1 rewards out the door!

Everywhere Else

We estimate beginning shipments by the end of the month. Currently we are waiting for the transport ships to arrive in their ports and for the inventory to be moved to their respective warehouses.

IMPORTANT!!!

Right now, it is CRITICAL that everyone confirms their shipping address and pays their shipping fees. Once you confirm your address it will be LOCKED, there WILL NOT be an opportunity to change your Wave 1 address. Please make sure that you’ve included apartment numbers, spelled everything correctly, and that your address is in English.

We will confirm your shipping addresses again for future shipping waves.

Our support team is available to help you at kingdomdeath.com/support

Policy 

We do not support the sale or transfer of pledges. Neither do we support the sale or transfer of Kickstarter or Backerkit accounts. Do not do this, we cannot help you with this in anyway!

Wave 1 Shipping Fee

I have lowered the shipping costs for many regions. I was able get slightly better shipping rates and I decided to eat the difference!
When Will I Get My Treasure?
I am doing my absolute best to coordinate everything so everyone receives their Wave 1 rewards as close to one another as possible. I am handling it myself, as no one cares as much about getting these games into your hands as I do. (Well except for maybe you guys!)

It's pretty insane. I am working with 10 warehouses and total of nearly 20 40-foot-long containers being shipped around the world—and that's just for Wave 1!

I ask for your patience and understanding. If any issues arise, you can rest assured that I’ll aggressively work to resolve them. My goal is to have everything shipped by the end of the month. That is not a promise, though. As often occurs with logistics, a minor delay can lead to much more downtime. In fact, here in the States we were held up by a week due to a driver shortage.

At the end of the day, I am still honored, humbled, and eternally grateful that Kingdom Death has developed as it has. Maybe one day I'll show off the original Twilight Knight sculpt from back when making just a single miniature felt impossible.

Now... nothing feels impossible!

LET'S START SHIPPING OUT THESE GAMES!!!
