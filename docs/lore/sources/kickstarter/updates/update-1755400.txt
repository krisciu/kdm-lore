Hello Everyone!

I am going to take a moment to speak openly. I never, ever expected this kickstarter campaign to come this far. We are currently the 2nd highest funded tabletop game and the 8th highest funded kickstarter project of all time.

In fact, even with this secret unplanned goal here, I thought we'd hit it next week wherein I'd have a bit more time to get things prepared.

AHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Perhaps I have underestimated the power of the form that transcends the transcended transcended form?!

Anyway. Here is what is happening!

The Satan twins, now destined for hard plastic, are being added to all the Satan's Lantern pledge levels. While cannon to KD, they were an artistic challenge from the original kickstarter. Plus... they wouldn't really fight survivors in that form (for lore reasons). All other backer's have access to them as optional Add-Ons. 

An expansion featuring their "final" form will appear during this campaign. If I had it ready now, I would certainly share it. But I don't! Apparently catching up on some much needed rest is a foolish for me right now! There was zero prior plan to include expansion during this kickstarter campaign, even in my most wild of funding expectations (which we have passed by the way)! I need to do some serious math, as I was planning a very LARGE monster. I'll have all the details together before I present it.

Gambler's Chest Roll

I made my roll for today and recorded it. I will be revealing it on Monday, along with Monday's roll. There will not be a roll on Sunday. I wasn't planning on having them on Saturday either (so I could catch up with messages) but I was staring at the dice and I couldn't resist!
