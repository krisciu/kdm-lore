We are now the #1 most funded game on kickstarter! 
I am thrilled! 
I am humbled! 

I am… overwhelmed with responsibility!
It’s down right sobering! 
That’s a lot of exclamation points!

Now to get serious.

Gambler’s Chest Change Add-On - $150 Due to overstuffing and my desire to continue said overstuffing and the absolute need to be fiscally responsible: The Add-On amount for extra Gambler’s Chest is now +$150, with two exceptions. If you have a Black Friday Lantern pledge or a Black Friday Lantern Upgrade Pledge, you may add 1 Gambler’s Chest to your rewards for $100. Thank you in advance for understanding.

Basically, if you have one in your pledge level its all fine and dandy. But if you WANT / NEED more then the 1 you already have... The add-on price is now $150. 

1.5 Core Game Add-On - $300 (25% off retail)
Adding multiple core games to a single pledge, will not save you on shipping. Each game is factory sealed into its own carton and it is too heavy to pack with another core game. As it would risk damaging both. Each must be shipped separately and we must pass this fee unto each backer. I am really sorry, but shipping is shipping.

Group Pledges

Our official stance is that we do not support group pledges. Each pledge will be treated as an individual user. We did our best to accommodate group pledges last campaign and we will not be doing so this time. I am confident that 99% of group pledgers are all awesome people, that I’d love to personally sit down and game with. Due to the size of the campaign, I have to make a firm stance and that is: it is something we do not support.

Selling Pledges

We do not support this. 

Combining Accounts

We do not support this nor will we combine pledges for individuals that have multiple kickstarter accounts or have bought pledges from other individuals, to make one uber katamari pledge level.

Pledge ManagerUntil the campaign is over, the dust has settled and myself and the team have been giving the opportunity to finalize math, manufacturing deals and the post pledge manager, I will not be divulging any details about what you can and cannot do. I very much understand and respect everyone’s personal budget and I love that you want to contribute more after the campaign ends. I will always work towards accommodating as much as I can. My focus is currently on the live kickstarter campaign, not the post campaign pledge manager. Thank you very much in advance for understanding.

Shipping Delays

Due to the size of our campaign and the staggering amount of content presented. There is a very real possibility we will see delays to the estimated shipping dates. Right now, it’s looking like everything will be pushed back 1-3 months. I won’t know until the campaign has ended and pledges are confirmed, so I know how many more core games we need to produce! (Don’t worry the ball is already rolling on this, but I do need to manage expectations.)

Ok! Finally, onto the content!

Just a quick reminder, the current CROSSOVER Projects are NOT INCLUDED in any pledge levels! Due to the IP being owned by another company, I cannot bundle them without extremely special permission! Thank you!
