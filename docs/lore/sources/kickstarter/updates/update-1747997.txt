Stretch Goals &amp; Stuff

This campaign is scheduled to run until Jan 7th. I want to have a surprise almost every day of this campaign and I will revealing add ons and stretch goals as soon as I can! I need time to catch up with everything, answer messages, get all the little bits of my exploded brain off the floor and scoop them back into my skull.

It also gives me some breathing room to perhaps stretch even FURTHER then I planned or even thought possible! 

What is the Changelog?

The change log is a list of changes and surprises for the 1.5 Core game and 1.5 Update Pack. These are not stretch goals, they were already planned and went off to production months ago. We have earned them all and as I get the chance I will reveal them and talk a bit about the changes. 

If your pledge includes a 1.5 core game or 1.5 update pack, you are already getting these. 

Does my pledge include the 1.5 core game?

Black Friday Lantern 

- Lantern
