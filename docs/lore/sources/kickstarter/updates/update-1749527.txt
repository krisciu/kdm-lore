First Narrative Sculpture revealed! 

And so the dice speak, and I reveal. White Fang, the Twilight Swordswoman is ready to join your hunting party and pounce into action! Use her to represent your favorite White Lion armored, Twilight Sword wielding survivor. A great way to get around the weapon's tricky cumbersome rule.

Cyber Monday Bonus! An additional bonus Added to the Gambler's Chest! ( no roll needed!)

Sci-fi Aya the Survivor joins the Gambler's Chest as a surprise bonus! Seemed appropriate with our silly shopping day and all. Oh and also the whole over 5 Million thing, which I am still in shock about. Has it really only been 3 days? Thankfully the team will be joining me monday morning ( in a mere 7 hours). 

Anyway, All of you are awesome. I can't wait to get all the cool stuff we have lined up and ready to slowly... one tiny piece at a time... slowly, reveal it to everyone. Bwa hahahaha! 

All right time for some sleep! Until tomorrow!!!!!!
