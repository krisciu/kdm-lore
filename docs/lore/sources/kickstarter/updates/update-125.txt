## A New Lantern Year

I hope everyone was able to have a fantastic New Years and Lunar New Years!

The team has returned from its winter recess, and we have been firing on all cylinders and excited to face the new year! As is custom, I spent my first two weeks of January planning our roadmap for the upcoming year. Laying out our schedule is always an invigorating process... I can't help but get hyped about all of the mindblowing projects we get to work on! 

Things will really start to get locked down once our manufacturing partners weigh in on over the next few weeks, but 2025 is shaping up to be an awesome year! I'll have more information to share on this next month in our upcoming timeline update.

## Pariah Expansion

On the topic of upcoming releases, I thought today would be a good opportunity to showcase some pre-production samples of the Pariah Expansion. This monster's got a real mean streak, and I can't wait for you all to experience it firsthand! 

Please note that we received these samples some time ago, so we've already worked with the factories to fix all of the color correction and other miscellaneous issues identified for production.

## Our Last Core Games in Stock

One final piece of exciting news, we are down to our very last core game sets! At this point in time, standalone core games are sold out worldwide, with only a handful of Starting Survivor Sets (Core Game + Gambler Chest bundle) left available in our US warehouse.

When we first began fulfilling the Core Game in 2016, I could have never in a million years imagined that this humble project would continue to receive this much love and attention, after so many years and reprints. 

In the coming days, I will be working with the team to finalize another new production run of the core game. But for today, I wanted to take my time to once again express my gratitude to this wonderful community of supporters, players, painters, backers, and bakcers. 

Thank you, for making my dream come true. May your lanterns always shine bright.
