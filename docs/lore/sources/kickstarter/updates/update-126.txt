Love and Taxes
Happy Valentine's Day everyone! In this month of love, the number one sentiment I've seen floating in the air, aside from the joy of romance, is the question of...tariffs! Will tariffs cause prices to skyrocket? How will tariffs affect upcoming releases and content that has been pledged for? What about distribution? What will happen to EVERYTHING?????

You, the community supporting us, have shown us a lot of love over these many years and we have in return, continued to create without restrictions! We have consistently over delivered rewards and put unimaginable effort and resources into every aspects of our projects.

Our current geopolitical climate is changing faster than it has ever before, and it has become increasingly difficult to make predictions on more and more aspects of the fulfillment cycle. In some respects, we are currently navigating an ever shifting catalog of changes and regulations that neither we nor our manufacturing, distribution, and fulfillment partners have had any experience with. 

In other respects, we have dealt with plenty of similar, less publicized (or in the case of Brexit, just as widely discussed) changes in costs to manufacturing and trade policy over the years. We, as always, we will commit our utmost efforts to doing right by our fans, backers, and bakcers. 

For example, the work we have done and will continue to put into the Dark Treasury arises directly from our desire to alleviate the increasingly onerous costs of global shipping for our supporters.

We have also done our best to not raise prices over the last few years, despite everything going up in cost.

I have several meetings lined up with our overseas suppliers with many points of strategy to discuss. In same cases they are willing to take on some of this new burden with us and we have accountants on both sides looking carefully into the exact rules we need to follow.

TAKE HEART! WE GOT PLENTY OF GREAT IDEAS!

- Sell Kings Coins Again!

- Increase the cost of the Core Game Reprint, make new fans pay for the sins of our past! (We are totally out of core games by the way)

- Charge an hourly rate for fans playing the sim!

- Add a gatcha to the sim!

- Painting contest where you pay us to enter!

- Sell all our miniatures as blind boxes, you never know what you are gonna get!

- Sell premium Kingdom Death Dice that have more 1's on them! 

- Lower prices in hopes it attracts new customers! 

- Start a new kickstarter for a totally new project, anyone up for that Death High Game? 

- Sell Adam's old paint cup water! 

And more!

All jokes aside tho. We will continue to be defiant and we will continue to make the absolute best things we can. Costs may have to go up a little bit, but not today. NOT FOR OUR VALENTIENS DAY SALE.

Our manufacturing partners have returned from CNY and have jumped straight into the production cycle for our upcoming releases. It has been about a week and a half since they resumed contact, and we just received mass production samples (Yesterday!) of content from the upcoming Remastered Shipping Wave 1, with more samples expected to be delivered to our HQ offices within the next two weeks.

As we are still waiting on communication from our manufacturing partners to confirm freight shipping sail dates for the contents of this upcoming wave, and in anticipation of receiving a more complete set of samples to showcase in the coming weeks, we will be holding off on updating our schedule until next month. Thank you for your patience and understanding.

We also got a load of new plastics test shots in, expect some lovely showcase photos of them next month!

Q: Curious because I forgot about it. Do we have a date the Terrain from the last black friday sale will be shipping?

A: We are currently making final tweaks and adjustments to the Ultimate Core Game Terrain set in order before moving on to engineering. We want to make sure that the terrain feels just as good when it is used with the default showdown board included with the core game as it does when it is combined with the Ultimate Showdown Board, so we are giving it the time and TLC it needs to fulfill that dream. I will have more information to share about the Ultimate Core Game Terrain as it gets closer to production and fulfillment.

Q: If you were to create a vignette of the Manhunter and / or the Lion knight how would you name them?

A: Hmmm…I don’t know just yet! At the very least, we’ll have to wait and see what the rest of the core game monsters have in store for us before moving onto Vignettes of Death centered around expansion monsters. 

Q: Was the number of campaigns saved in the KDS simulator changed to only 1?

I remember vaguely reading you could store up to 5.

I cleared out 3 older campaigns to run a squire campaign on the sim, in addition to the one I was playing with my friends, I couldn't save the squire campaign and when I checked the stone cloud info, it states you can only save one campaign now. I hope they change this back.

A: This shouldn’t be the case. You should still be able to track up to 5 campaigns at a time with your Stone Cloud. I’ve spoken with the Dark Architects about looking into this bug. We’ll get things fixed up as soon as possible!

Q: Hello - can you please try to make it so that the 3D terrain sits on top of the showdown board instead of having tiles be removed and pieces slotted in? I've glued the tiles onto my board.

A: Unfortunately, we do not have plans at the time to make the Ultimate Core Terrain sit atop the Ultimate Showdown Board. Though I have explored multiple approaches with my engineering team, we concluded that the best way forward was to follow through with our original plans to take advantage of the modular removable tiles of the Ultimate Showdown Board. 

Otherwise, there would be no feasible way for us to ensure the correct size and proportions of the terrain in relation to other board tiles or models.

Q: Are you planning an update to the core game like last time or just a reprint of the current version?

A: Our official newsletter would be the best place to go for news on the core game. We have always valued both ensuring that all of your Kingdom Death content remains compatible and to improving the overall play experience, so you can be assured that if there are any changes that are made to the core game, we will have a way for more experienced players to easily update their game, such as a legendary card pack.

Q: any comment on version 2.0 of the core game??

A: When we haven’t even released KDM 1.665 or KDM 1.666 yet?

Q: could you tell us if the new tariff are going to affect any and all of our outstanding products??

A: I addressed this at the start of the update!
