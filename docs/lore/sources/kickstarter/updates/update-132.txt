## Screaming God Update

[IMAGE]

I initially delayed the Screaming God expansion due to improvements that I felt we could have made on both the model and gameplay of the Parasite Queen, and I am happy to announce that we have wrapped on these changes. Plastic production is finished, with paper production to follow soon. Excepting for any back and forth that would be required for QA considerations, we are hoping to receive a full expansion sample in the near future.

Though it should come as no surprise at this point, I was still startled by how CHUNKY the Screaming God expansion ended up being! I thought I had given us plenty of leeway when I approximated that the expansion would contain 120 bridge cards during our initial pitch, and we ROCKETED past that number with over 200+ bridge cards, another 45+ page rulebook, and some truly sizable boards. We even managed to slip a Vignette showdown into the expansion!

## Campaigns of Death Delay

Campaigns of Death Volume 1 is not yet ready for print. The expansion needs more TLC until it is up to my standards, and I want to ensure that all of our ducks are in a row before sending it out. Our goal with Campaigns of Death is twofold, to provide a dizzying array of new permutations with which to experience your existing expansions and to provide a solid foundation for all of our future design to stand upon.

It is imperative to me that we get this right, and it needs more time in order to properly fulfill these roles. 

That stated, while we continue to hone the content of Campaigns of Death into its most powerful, final final form, we are not allowing it to bottleneck our progress. We have begun receiving samples of the hard plastic found in Campaigns of Death, so that we can QA them for production. It is an important step of the process to ensure that we do not experience any unacceptable loss of detail, major misfits, broken connection points, etc. 

Please humbly excuse us while we get chase down these finicky fowl!

All of the hard plastic tooling for COD has been finished! Here are the last few items from the massive COD collection of figures all wrapped up. While the original intent was to keep the Dark Flower and Skyking Armor more scaled back... we uh...ended up making them both massive kits, with loads of options!

## Expansions of Death Painting Contest

[IMAGE]

I wanted to take the opportunity to do a quick follow-up on the Expansions of Death Painting Contest here! We needed some time to adjust our workflow behind the scenes in order to ensure a smoother/more frequent contest experience in the future. Though we experienced some unfortunate delays on this front, I am happy to announce that we are wrapping up judgment on all of the wonderful entries submitted by the community, and should have the results announcements by next month's update.

As per usual, top prizes will require communication and time to fabricate, but we should be able to distribute participation prizes almost immediately this time around thanks to our aforementioned updates!

## A Message on the Future

And so we head towards Black Friday and the end of the year after a pretty wild summer. We have already blown through over half our core game restock, and I've placed another production order in as Black Friday might come pretty close to wiping out our stock again. 

The enthusiasm from the fans (many of you included!) has been infectious, the team is fired up and its feels like many of these long winded projects are finally coming to a close. I'll save it for next month, but all of the hard plastic for the Honeycomb Weaver expansion is finished too! The engineering team has been focused solely on finishing the last outstanding armor kits (Gryphon armor is looking sick) and we have been chipping away at the massive project that is the Ivory Dragon.

I always saw our speed as a weakness, one area of the overall operation that I wanted to correct. It's hard to deny the quality that taking the long winded route is capable of though. As we race as a global culture towards a most likely AI fueled multimedia explosion - maybe its ok that some projects are long, slow and made by human hands from start to finish.

Who knows! I am merely a humble board game designer, thrilled that people want to play the dream game (and its many many many expansions) I always wanted to create.

Thank you for continuing this journey with me. We got lots of things in store for the end of the year! (Including a real push to get things off to print!)

I'll touch on dates and timelines later, for now let me enjoy the afterglow of a successful summer of happy development and gaming. Thank you in advance for your understanding and your support!

Q: Will the Fade/Percival/etc pillar cards and art cards be included in a future legendary card pack since so many have the originals already?

A: All updated gameplay content in the Fade and Percival rereleases will be included in an upcoming legendary card pack. However, cosmetic items such as artwork are not included within card packs.

Q: This Black Friday will there be an 2025 indomitable bundle? I already have all the 2024 stuff.

A: I’ll speak with the team about dividing up the bundles!

Q: Do we have any word on when the Screaming God is supposed to ship to US backers? I thought I'd seen an update mentioning it for Wave 1 but didn't see it mentioned in this latest update...

A: In our most recent news discussing the Screaming God expansion, I mentioned that I had placed a minor delay on the expansion to ensure that everything was up to our standards. We have since finished design on the expansion and are moving on to the initial stages of production.

Q: At what point should we be concerned by the non-delivery of wave 1?

A: If you have not yet received any of the content you pledged for that is part of Revamped Shipping Wave 1 at this point in time, please reach out to our support.

Q: Was the short 3/5 yearh campaign for the Red Witches scrapped at one point? Sorting through stuff and I see nothing in the rule book.

A: Yes. To quote a previous answer I gave to a similar question: “It became clear very early on in testing that players should not be given gameplay control of such powerful beings in comparison to the regular survivor, at least not within the confines of Kingdom Death Monster.”

This idea was replaced with the additional “white speaker story” events that have a similar purpose of showcasing key parts of Kingdom Death’s lore without stepping out of the “survivor’s perspective”.

Q: Looking forward to wave 2, how large is the Campaigns of Death expansion?

A: Now that we have begun plastic production on the expansion, we can finally start collecting data on weight for the purposes of box design/shipping considerations. Based on initial calculations, it is looking like the box of CoD Vol. 1 will be the same footprint as the Core Game. 

Q: Will CoD include enough room to put all the old expansions?? Or just enough for the new content?

A: It’s difficult to provide a definitive answer on this, as many players have very different storage solutions for their collection, whether it be bespoke organizers, sleeved or unsleeved, etc. The current plan is to provide as much space as possible for players to use as generalized storage, once shipping considerations have been met.

Q: What is the status of the CoD and the screaming god?

A: I touched upon this earlier in the update!

Q: With the Pariah and Red witches arriving world-wide, and visiting up our settlement's, I have a few questions about the screaming God. Will he appear immediately after the core monster is defeated, and add a set amount of years to the campaign, ending with the Parasite queen, ( I remember reading this once, and he destroys the settlement, forcing survivors to rebuild.) Or will he be like other quarries, appearing at a set year and giving us an opportunity to hunt him when our settlements ready? Secondly, the question on every ones mind, is he still on schedule to be delivered in the near future?

A: The Screaming God becomes available for the settlement to hunt at a similar point in the timeline to the King. When we reviewed our node system, we made the determination that monsters such as the Screaming God would fit more neatly within the system in the node 4 quarry slot, which does not require an extension of your campaign.

The introduction story of the Screaming God was changed from “destroying the settlement” to something much more relevant to the overarching narrative of the monster once we locked down its place within Kingdom Death’s ecology, though I will leave the specifics for players to discover when they receive the expansion themselves.

The Parasite Queen can still be the Finale monster for a campaign featuring the Screaming God, but we ultimately decided to separate the monsters so that each can be added to your campaign without the presence of the other. We wanted to be flexible with where the Parasite Queen can show up, especially with CoD Vol. 1 on the horizon and how influential of a presence the Parasite Queen is within the world of KD.

Q: Good to hear Gencon went so well! Hope I can make the trip across the ocean one day.
But the biggest question of the month was missed! CoD was meant to go to print by august. Did it make it?

A: I touched upon this earlier in the update!

Q: Possibly stupid question, can we just leave the current wave stuff in the dark treasury and have it all ship when CoD drops or is there a chance if will go out of stock if we dont ship it now?

A: Not a stupid question at all! The Dark Treasury is intended to be a “holding area” for your pledged items, so feel free to leave them in your treasury until you are ready to ship. Though we are unable to hold items for you indefinitely, you will receive ample notification if we are unable to hold your items any longer.  

Q: Is there a lore reason why the Red Witches are so massive? They make all the other White Speakers look tiny, including White Speaker Nico.

A: The size of the models is partially to give the Red Witches more table presence so that they can be easily identified while on the showdown board, but it is also true that narratively the Red Witches (and all White Speakers, to lesser extents) are able to shift the size of their bodies. The details of what specific story they are using to do so will have to be left for another time though!

Q: With Canada postal service on strike again and the preorder for the last waves is going out. Does an alternative courrier been planned?

A: Yes!
