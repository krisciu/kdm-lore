##  

## The pledge manager is closing March 23rd at 1PM EST.

Everyone will be charged for any extra add-ons they have made via backerkit starting then. Backers that have failed to fill out their survey run the risk of forfeiting their pledge. It is essential that all survey's are complete so we can lock in production numbers.

The pledge manager will reopen before wave 1 ships to collect your wave 1 shipping fee. I have yet to decide if backers will have the opportunity to pledge for more content when we reopen it. Please do not expect it.

Leftover credit in backerkit can be used to pay for your upcomming shipping fee's. 

We cannot refund additional / left over backerkit credit at this time. 

If you have any issues, please head over to our support page:
kingdomdeath.com/support

Support related messages that come thru via kickstarter have a high chance of being missed, do not seek help through it. I don't want to miss your messages! We want to help you!

## What happens if I don't fill out backerkit? 

There is no longer a guarantee that some or all of your rewards will be delivered to you. Instead we might only be able to offer a refund with at least 10% removed to cover our non-recoverable fee's. (Kickstarter, Stripe, Backerkit, Production Fee's etc...) You MUST finalize your pledge otherwise we will have inaccurate production numbers. We cannot give backers with forfeited pledges production units that have been allocated to our retail release. I am begging you, please finalize your pledge.

Late Backers that fail to complete their pledge will simply be removed from our system. 

I apologize but I do not have much flexibility room here. I cannot simply order "enough" and hope people finalize their pledges in a timely fashion. The project is very large and to ensure that everything goes smoothly I must be strict.

We will of course, always do everything we can to accommodate people with special circumstances. Please reach out via our support page, not kickstarter.

This is a very critical update, hence I have decided to wait on actual content progress and risk distracting all the important information above.

Thank you in advance for understanding.

Ah... well I can't really leave the update without anything fun. Here is a 1/8th scale Cockroach Queen!
