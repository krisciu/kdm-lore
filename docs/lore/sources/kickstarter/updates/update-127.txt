Remastered Wave 1 estimated fulfillment Mid July 2025. Screaming God Expansion Delayed, Philosophies of Death Gatherism added to Remastered Wave 1.

(Remastered Wave 1 = Red Witches Expansion, Pariah Expansion, Wanderer Goth Amy, Aeneas, Hyperlight Drifter, Candy &amp; Cola, Gatherism, Percival).

TLDR; list of things to be outraged about!

- Tariffs! Who is gonna pay!

- Screaming God Delayed!

- All projects pushed back on the estimated timeline!!!

- Kingdom Death game dev speed is still too slow (actually I think its perfect)!!!

- Permission granted to rage at me if this takes longer then 10 years!!!!!!

- Core Game Reprint… but most likely not in time for Gencon!!!!!!!

Welcome one and all to the official “Lets get Angry” update! Here in the United States, we now have tariffs on the incoming goods from China, so we are facing down a 25% increase on the costs of all Kingdom Death expansions and pretty much everything for this kickstarter. There is no time to change factories for this shipping wave and thus no way out of it. There is even a chance that borders decide that the value of the goods are HIGHER than the waybill and we get hit even harder! Honestly this is a wait and see situation. If possible, I'd love to shoulder 50% of the costs from everyone. 

Another thing to get angry about - I am delaying the Screaming God expansion. It’s not ready yet, the Parasite Queen (which has turned out AMAZING btw!) had some extra back and forth in both its hard plastic production and the final boss fight. I had to formally remove it from this wave so as to not hold up everything else that is finished.

Our game dev speed, continues to be much slower than what some members of our community feel it should be. I acknowledge that. What was supposed to be a 5 year project has doubled in time and is looking more like a 10 year project! Regardless, I am extremely proud of what we have created so far and I remain steadfast excited about everything we are working on now. Creating Kingdom Death takes time and the dedication of a lot of talented people.  Far as creating what I feel is the “best” tabletop experience on planet has to offer - the development speed is perfect. I love our game. It still slaps and is insanely fun to play!

The simple truth is, no one else would make this game. We have carved out our own difficult and challenging to follow path - fueled by enthusiasm and a need to always make the end quality of our products just a little bit better than the last one.

If by 2027 we have still not finished this kickstarter, I give you all full permission to outrage (if you want!) I’ll drum up some appropriate t-shirts to distribute and allow for an official no comment moderation venting day. Maybe live stream myself in a dunk tank (filled with black water of course) and let Bra Mithra and Fen pitch balls in honor of members of the community.

Lastly, we have a 1.6 core game reprint rolling…. But it’s not looking like it will be ready in time for Gencon! Which means we will be showing up to a trade show meant to introduce new fans to the world of Kingdom Death… with no core games aside from the 10ish games we've been holding onto for events and replacements! Lol! 

Anyway! Let’s go on with the update!

## Remastered Wave 1

Remastered Wave 1 Production is scheduled to be finished mid may 2025. Delivery should be happening around mid July 2025. So it looks like fulfillment right before Gencon again!

Screaming God Expansion delayed, and will be available for shipping separately. It will go out before the next shipping wave, but if you'd like for it to ship out with a full shipping wave, you can also wait and have it combined (via Dark Treasury) with your pledged rewards for Remastered Wave 2.

I happily hold in my hands mass production samples of the Red Witches, Wanderer - Goth, Wanderer - Aeneas, Wanderer - Death Drifter, and Wanderer - Candy and Cola! Oh, and Philosophies of Death - Gatherism too! We're moving Philosophies of Death Gatherism up from Remastered Wave 2 to Remastered Wave 1. Surprise!

Q: Any idea on when we can see the second legendary card pack?

A: Yes. Legendary Card Pack II has had most of its contents finalized, though we are still waiting to make some final decisions before beginning production. It will not be part of the next shipping wave, though we hope to have the card pack available in our webstore this year.

Q: So is there an ETA on wave 4?

A: I covered our current schedule estimates earlier this update!

Q: Why would tariffs affect the cost on something already purchased? The KS launched almost a DECADE ago. The price changes should be absorbed by the supplier for not being able to deliver on time.

A: This is a crowdfunding project and not a preorder. We have given estimates that lead up to solid deliverable dates. Once a solid deliverable date has been shared, we have not been late on that. If you are experiencing frustration, you are more than welcome to reach out to us, and we work out a solution. We have no interest in holding your money hostage. We are creating a very large and intricate passion project and would still love your support with that. In regards to tariffs, we have never stated that backers would have to absorb it. We have been strategizing and reviewing our financials, and have no official word on it yet.

Q: Hey Adam, any chance of a naked armour sale for the Gamblers Chest? I've built the 'cool' looking models for the Crimson Croc, but now need another two at least to build the ones we actually use! Same will happen with the Smog ones when I get to it. I seem to have x8 survivors of every other Armour Set, so I know it's been done before for me to buy them.

A: I’m happy to gauge the community's interest for something like this! If you need more of a specific sprue from a product you own, you could also reach out to our support team. Depending on stock, we should have a cache of replacement and additional sprues available for a la carte purchase.

Q: Why was that the lion god changed from being a new entity that will hunt you if you killed too many white lions vs a new monster??

A: The Lion God is a great example of a monster whose role shifted drastically after more narrative and mechanical explorations were done for the expansion. It simply became clear over the course of development that there was much more to the story of the Lion God than just being a mechanic meant to punish players from not having enough hunt variety. That isn’t to say that the Lion God is completely unrelated to lions though. More insights into that particular connection will become clear in the upcoming Silver City expansion.

## New Releases in the Store

We got some cool new stuff in the store! Please support us so that I can build out a path to cover these tariffs! Oh, but purchase responsibly. Don’t put yourself out for our sake. Thanks!!!

We create our larger art prints in house on a slow moving but INSANELY GORGEOUS inkjet printer. The process leaves the print feeling like its actually glowing! The Rain Stalker print (illustrated by KyuYong Eom) feels radiant in your hands.

The KDS update today adds our first past at social features, making it more easy to join peoples games and adding some much requested moderation features!

Lastly, a big THANK YOU to everyone for joining us on this journey turned Odyssey! Tomorrow I return to Campaigns of Death. Our print Deadline is August, so we gotta wrap it up!
