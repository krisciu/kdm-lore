I am extending the timeline to ensure the quality of the project is not compromised for any reason. Please temper expectations as my demands and global circumstances will cause delays, pushing us into an early 2021 delivery date.

Why are you delaying again!?

Twofold, internally, the additional content I added to the Gambler’s Chest and Campaigns of Death are not yet complete. We can also confidently say that manufacturing and logistics will be profoundly affected by the pandemic facing the world.

You can’t keep delaying forever! This isn’t right to the backers!

In light of your excitement, I sincerely apologize. However, I will delay any aspect of this project until it meets my personal satisfaction. This includes scrapping and recreating assets or adding more content where I see fit.

Don’t you feel bad about this at all?

Of course I do! I wistfully pass the hard plastic Dragon Goblin in the office everyday and it breaks my heart that you guys aren’t being ground into bird food by it! Looking at it and comparing it to say, the original Crimson Crocodile... is what made me realize WE HAD to resculpt the Crocodile. To me, it just did not stand up at the same level of quality of the rest of Kingdom Death. Here is the original croc for everyone to see:

It is with deep respect and love for the project, which includes the team, myself and all of you guys, that I continue to push things so hard. And yes, that can really add to the amount of time it takes to complete any detail of the project as a whole. It took over a year to Sculpt the Gambler by hand, and I can’t think of any other project crazy enough to pursue its own vision like Kingdom Death. And I love that!

What I can say now though, is that the end is in sight, the sheer mountain of work has come down, and I humbly ask you to wait so we can do this right.

Covid 19

Here in NYC the departure from normal has been extreme and the last 10 weeks have sucked big time.

Initially, I thought I could transform some part of this into an opportunity. An empty office with no distractions was extremely enticing! I was going to get SO MUCH DONE! Turns out trying to be happy and productive while sirens blared around you 24 hours a day and your city shut around you was overly optimistic. First, scrambling to settle the parts of the team that can work remotely, delivering supplies, adjusting to life without school or childcare, shops, restaurants, our team, our extended family and friends, disinfecting groceries and incoming packages, and tackling sudden loss, have all taken, not just mine, but everyone’s time and energy. Time that has been essential to take.

The safety of our team is paramount to us.  We are complying with all safety guidelines outlined by the CDC, NYC and NY state. In NYC that means Kingdom Death HQ has been closed from the middle of March and continues to be shut.

Despite our closed doors, we are fully supporting our team, including those that cannot work due to the city’s mandates.

I am 2…maybe 3 months behind where I expected to be at this point in time. The extension reflects that and adds some padding as we continue to figure out how to effectively steward the project under lockdown.

All of this feels… does not feel good Poots.

You are right. And it is 10 billion percent my fault. Please direct all your frustration and disappointment directly at me.  The entire planet is struggling and I should have reached out to you guys much sooner.  I will own that.

I also extend a personal invitation to anyone that wants to bend my ear for any reason. Be it related to Kingdom Death or personal. I am here and I will listen. Just send me a direct message or email me at adampoots [at] kingdomdeath.com

Kingdom Death Communities

I appreciate, admire, and value the communities that have built themselves up around Kingdom Death. Thank you, your voices are heard. I do feel however, that I need to make it clear that I am not looking for any official community involvement or play testing at this time. I look forward to a point in the future wherein that can be a reality. But I cannot take on, nor oversee any more projects at this time.

Also. 

Please.

Calm.

Down.

Thank you.

Kingdom Death is not going anywhere. My commitment to the project, to you, to the team and to myself is unbreakable.

And finally, please allow me the humble honor of sharing!

## Wave 3 - Gambler's Chest

Let's start with what's left. The King showdown needs to move from notes to playtesting. The Smog Singers are waiting for a polish pass from me, Godhand is also waiting on me for tuning before it hits the table again. The art orders for the new story events are in and are slowly being finished. Collective Cognition, The Scout System and the Philosophy system all have an incredible amount of testing data at this point and I need to make refinements to the system before pushing them back out to the team. Oh and Atnas is pretty much picture perfect!

Manufacturing-wise here is what's left: The Bone Eaters are waiting on their custom bases, Nightmare Adam is in queue for engineering (thats the process where we draft and split the model for plastic production), The Smog Singers Armor, King Armor and Crimson Crocodile Armor are all currently being sculpted and will be in queue for engineering and tooling asap. Everything else is finished and production on them has been completed. They await their last few plastic sprue friends to complete this massive set!

## Wave 3 - Campaigns of Death

Whats left? The Dung Beetle Baron needs his massive dung ball! Debating on adding a Devilweed Slenderman (so pleased with the Verdant Lord its hard to resist!). The 3 hybrid armor sets need to be sculpted (2 of them have approved artwork).

Development-wise there is a tremendous amount of testing data on most campaigns, I need to review it again and start to make updates. Then some of the story events need tweaking and a better KD lore pass. Thats the kinda thing that generally only Anna or myself can tackle. There are about... 20 pieces of art I am still waiting for, for the book too.

The strain system is looking good! I am very pleased with it so far. As I tie up the campaigns from the book, I expect the rest of the strain system to fall into place. The strain system is after all, an extension of story telling and being in that mindset really helps me to define and create the unique feeling highlights these cards need. The overall rules need a pass too, right now they read a bit "crunchy".

## Wave 3 - Pinups of Death

We had a few last minute tooling updates. The Pinup DBK had some warpage issues making her hard to assemble. The Pinup Black Knight was missing a piece from the sprue! Beyond that, all of this is 100% complete! I know it will sound crazy but I kinda forgot. lol! Towards the end of next week I will push forward with finalizing the box art and the little includes for these sets, and well, get this out the door! I am fine with breaking this off ahead of the rest of Wave 3.

## Stone Face Base Inserts

I am going to aim to include these in the broken off wave along with the pinups of death. They have not been tooled yet, but it is a simple project compared to a set of miniatures.

## Legendary Card Pack

The contents of the Legendary Card Pack have been finalized and await production! Thank you to everyone who offered suggestions or highlighted necessary fixes, your feedback has been taken into account. Just so you guys know, I have delegated the card pack to the team. They are moving it forward with just my approvals, so it can be one of those projects that gets finished and I don’t keep held up, trying to cram in extras indefinitely.

## FUCK YES TITAN BEE!

I love this thing. I really do. That's it, it’s gonna be our next shirt. Oh yeah! The T-Shirt guys on our block are still operating! They got special permission from the city since they are making masks! Anyway, I want to share that love. Can we please pick out 5 painters that NEED this Bee? We will ship these out to you if you share what you get up to on Instagram!

## Showdown Board

We've been hard at work, busting our brains over how to bring everyone the very best showdown board. It must be gorgeous and it must be playable without a hitch. After much deliberation and experimentation, we have decided on the following (and yes this is STILL subject to change):

  - Each tile will be individual, instead of baked into a larger plate.

  - The height of the tiles is about 15mm, I wanted them to be tall so we could have DEEP details and create really pretty relief work.

  - There will be a lattice of sorts so that each tile can be placed snuggly the perfect distance apart, which is a little bit further than the grids between the tiles on the showdown board. Making the overall showdown board a little bigger, but the luxe feeling is perfect.

  - Each tile will be treated like its own separate tiny project, to ensure that even as a stand alone it’s gorgeous. They will also be numbered so you can set them up just like the final renders.

  - Some tiles will be multipart, to ensure we nail the particular effect of that tile.

  - With every tile being separate and removable, it opens up the possibility for terrain...

Here are some renders! We are not 100% finished yet, but it is getting closer and closer every day!

## The Kings Coins

[IMAGE]

Thank you to the genius that made this! 

[IMAGE]

I really liked this idea! I thought it was a fun version of the vouchers issued by other businesses currently unable to operate. The reason I pulled them so quickly was two-fold. We didn’t have the technical solution in place to make it worked like I wanted AND it caused tension for a part of our community. Things are hard right now, I didn’t want to be the cause of more concern for anyone. Anyway, what’s done is done. The coins have been collected, and for the overwhelming amount of fans who messaged or emailed me who loved the idea of a King’s Coin…they have been re-minted and I present them to you anew:

  - The Newly Minted Kings Coins will be a physical coin produced by us in either resin or photoresin. They will be shipped to the receiver along with a certificate of authenticity.

  - They will not give you early access to releases on our web store.

  - They do not have monetary value as a gift card.

  - They can be, old school, mailed in and redeemed for an exclusive deathgrey resin miniature that has no game rules. The miniature will be revealed during or leading up to our Black Friday sale.

  - This exclusive miniature will be made on demand to ensure that supplies do not run out during its redemption period.

  - King's Coins are earned under specific changing circumstances. We may offer one to a fan that shared an amazingly painted Kingdom Death miniature with us, we may run contests with them as prizes. And we may offer them to fans that help monetarily support bold new directions, unrelated to this kickstarter, that the brand experiments with. (For example, a line of housewares, a video game or 1/8th scale model kits!)

Of course there is no need, nor pressure to redeem your King's Coin. As an owner of one, you are more than welcome to keep it has part of your collection and KD's history.

## Offical Instagram &amp; Fan Art Contest

[IMAGE]

Without the opportunity to meet face-to-face, we have launched our official Instagram, @kingdomdeath! While the team has been holed up, we’ve been using this platform to keep in touch with each other. While perusing through the models you’ve painted, the campaigns you’ve played, and the many many horrible deaths you’ve experienced, a certain piece of easter fan art caught our eye. @robot_jones_‘s Rawhide Bunny Survivor Easter fan art! And so we made Fan art of fan art! the team had a blast sculpting her!

We are formalizing rules for a fan art contest so we can formally do more! Oh and you guessed it, this contest will be a way for some people to earn a King’s Coin, among other prizes.

## How is your pandemic going, Adam?

Social distancing +1 insanity. Locked down NYC +1 insanity. Social game. Board game. Pandemic. Remote play testing. Sirens all day long +3 insanity. Family might get sick +3 insanity. Why does everyone keep buying toilet paper? Uncle in Ireland Passed Away. Alone in Office. Anxiety. Must channel into something productive. Animal Crossing. Breathing Exercises. Tom Nook +21 insanity. Skype Parties. Zoom Birthdays +12 isanity. Grateful for the home gym. TURNIPS +10,000 insanity. FF7 Remake. Why is Tifa so skinny +7 insanity? SO MANY BELLS. Limit Break. Staycation. Insanity Limit Surpassed. TOOOM NOOOOOOKKKK. BRAIN EXPLOSION!!!!!

I’m gonna be honest. I felt immense pressure to help our team and you guys play KD:M with friends and loved ones that shouldn't or couldn't leave their homes. I wanted it to be on brand and to be something we could build towards and maybe grow into a larger part of the whole.

I looked high and low, all over the internet. I didn't see a single NOT EVEN ONE, MOST CERTAINLY NOT ANY WAY TO PLAY KINGDOM DEATH REMOTELY. THIS IS MY OFFICIAL STANCE. DO NOT QUESTION IT! ANY TYPE OF SOFTWARE LIKE THAT CERTAINLY EXISTS WITHOUT MY PERMISSION. SO I REALLY DIDN'T SEE IT AND DON'T KNOW WHAT ANYONE IS TALKING ABOUT! THANK YOU FOR YOUR UNDERSTANDING. LETS JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT.

## Kingdom Death: Showdown Tracker 0.1A?!

[IMAGE]

[IMAGE]

 So I hired a pair of talented developers.

They are developing software, to help bring us back to the table safely. Something that will inject some feeling and fidelity, more than a webcam, a google doc and Skype. I love those things, but we needed to improve and fast.

We want to share what we’ve made so far with you. We are making our experimental Showdown Tracker Alpha (PC and OS X) available to anyone that owns a copy of Kingdom Death. Find it on the shop now and enjoy some help with your socially distant KDM. Please make sure you login to your shop account so we can more accurately track interest in the project. Much exciting! Oh and the budget for this is purely coming from the resin sales from the store. Nothing to do with the kickstarter funds.

Here is the  Showdown Tracker.

Discount Code for KD:M owners: IOWNKDM

For now, the Showdown Tracker will remain very simple and aim to have the following features:

  - Virtual Board and the ability to move a camera around it.

  - Ability to move miniatures on virtual board.

  - Miniature Rotation! woo!

  - Miniature Knockdown! yay! (K)

  - D10 Rolling.

  - Hit Location Dice Rolling.

  - Simple Chat.

  - Local Hosting.

  - Client Side Hosting (you will need to forward port 8080 or use software like logmein hamachi). Also please do not share your IP with anyone you don't personally know, or post it online!

  - White Lion.

  - Starting Survivors.

  - Monster Controller Panel.

  - (future) 100 mm Base and 120mm Base to track larger monsters position.

Right now most of these are in place and better yet... they mostly work! woo! 

The team has been insanely excited about this development and I must admit. I am too! Our developers are great and beyond directing I can safely say that this is taking a minimum amount of my time. We are at the very beginning of something new! I intend to get the Alpha as polished as possible and we will all just see how it goes!

## SACRED BACKER TIME

Thats right. It's coming back! Starting next Friday, every week for a month I will be making an update. Even if I don't have... anything to share or say! I am deeply uncomfortable communicating unless I feel ready and so, I do this because I care and because I understand that it has been a long time. I get it. I want you guys to feel as good about the project as I do and I know the only THE ONLY way to really bridge that gap is more communication for the time being.

So I'm gonna do it. I'll cap the update time to 2 hours of my time spent total. And I will just share whatever I can and if there is nothing well, I'll tell you about that too!

I think that's really about it. Tomorrow I will wake up and work on Kingdom Death. The day after that I will wake up and work on Kingdom Death. The day following that I will wake up and work on Kingdom Death and so on and so on and so on, until the day a small, easy to carry package arrives at your door. And then your delivery man will thank you for it not being too heavy. And while I am still working away on Kingdom Death, you will be unpacking and hopefully enjoying the contents of a small, modest sized box. And hopefully you won't have to fucking disinfect your packages by then!

Oh, did I ever tell you guys about Questing Lucy? I started painting her but never finished!

[IMAGE]

P.S. ACK! I forgot to add the really dank Sky Armor hybrid Armor that is going to be part of the Campaigns of Death! Here is the artwork for it real quick!

[IMAGE]

[IMAGE]

P.P.S. CHECK THE BLUSHING OWL OUT!!!

[IMAGE]

P.P.P.S. Oh Yeah! We finished the Possessed Twilight Knight Crossover and will be fullfilling it for Ninja Division / Soda Pop miniatures. 

[IMAGE]

P.P.P.P.P.P.S. FUCK THIS PANDEMICCCCCCCCCCC!!!!!!!!!!!

PPPPPPPPSSSSSSSSSS. I LOVE YOU ANNA HAPPY MOTHERS DAY! SORRY WE WORKED ALL DAY!!!!
