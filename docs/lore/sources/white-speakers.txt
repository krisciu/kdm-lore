White Speaker - Sword Hunter
There was a settlement of humans so powerful that they defied one of the great entities. In response,
the entity drank their only lake and waited for them to turn to dust. Undaunted, the humans grew
plants rich in water and survived. The furious entity took up its mantle and invaded, wiping out the
humans. It le� one man as a warning, cursed with an unslakable thirst.
Desperate to end his su�ering, the man took up the sword, mastering it with single-minded focus.
Exactly 1000 years to the day, the Prince of the Sword stood triumphant over the dying entity. Drinking
its blood quenched his thirst for the first time but did not end his torment. Eternally he wanders
drinking the blood of worthy adversaries to momentarily satisfy his thirst.
White Speakers that tell the story of the Prince of Swords seek the taste of blood stains and remnants
of gore on ancient weapons. In this way gaining the prowess of their former wielders

White Speaker Nico
Long ago, the White Speaker cult's savagery threatened the few enclaves of human civilization. The
Order of Twilight Knights rose up nearly destroying the cult. Now, small covens of White Speakers can
be found meeting in abandoned places, sharing the secrets of their blood magic, passed on from one
White Speaker to another through intricate tales, whispered and screamed in frenzied, transcendental
rituals.
Nico is a second White Speaker in the Kingdom Death range. She represents more aspects of the White
Speaker cult, their ritual garb and weapons.
Mountain Man
Part of the reason there are no Male White Speakers...
