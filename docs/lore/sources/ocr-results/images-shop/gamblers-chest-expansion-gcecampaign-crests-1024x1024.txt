This appears to be a purely artistic/decorative image from Kingdom Death: Monster's Gambler's Chest expansion. The image shows a silhouette-style illustration with a dark circular mass at the top (possibly representing a brain or thought cloud) above a figure's head/shoulders containing small human silhouettes. Below are seven small decorative emblems or symbols arranged in a row. There is no visible text, card titles, rules, or other readable content in this image.
