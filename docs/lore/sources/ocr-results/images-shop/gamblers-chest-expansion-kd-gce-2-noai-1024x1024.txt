Looking at this Kingdom Death: Monster gambler's chest image, I can identify the following visible text:

**DEADISM**
*FRAMEWORK EDITION*

The image shows various game components including miniatures, cards, and what appears to be rulebooks or card decks. However, due to the angle and resolution of the photograph, most of the specific card text, rules, and detailed content is not clearly legible enough to accurately transcribe.

The image appears to show:
- Multiple unpainted miniatures on bases
- Several card decks with dark covers featuring ornate designs
- What appears to be rulebooks or reference materials
- Various game components typical of the Kingdom Death: Monster system

[Most detailed text content is not clearly readable in this image due to viewing angle and resolution]
