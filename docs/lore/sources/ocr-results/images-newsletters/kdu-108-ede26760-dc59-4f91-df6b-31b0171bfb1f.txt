This image shows painted miniature figures from Kingdom Death: Monster arranged on a dark background. The figures appear to be warriors or survivors with various weapons and armor, but there is no visible text, card information, rules text, or other readable content in the image. This appears to be a showcase photograph of painted game miniatures rather than game cards or rulebook content.
