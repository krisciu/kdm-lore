This image shows a painted miniature figure from Kingdom Death: Monster - appears to be a heavily armored warrior character with spiky armor, a red beard, wielding weapons and standing on a base with skulls. However, there is no visible text, card information, rules, or other readable content in this image. It appears to be a showcase photograph of a painted game miniature against a black background.
