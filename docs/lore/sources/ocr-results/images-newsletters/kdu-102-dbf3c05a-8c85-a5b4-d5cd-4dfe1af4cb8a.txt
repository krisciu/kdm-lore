The image shows two artistic illustrations that appear to be from Kingdom Death: Monster, but they are purely artwork without any visible text, card names, rules text, or other readable content. The top illustration depicts a dark scene with multiple characters including what appears to be someone with blonde hair and various shadowy figures. The bottom illustration shows a dramatic scene with flowing blue elements (possibly water or energy) and what appears to be a wooden structure. Both are decorative artwork pieces without any game text or mechanics visible.
