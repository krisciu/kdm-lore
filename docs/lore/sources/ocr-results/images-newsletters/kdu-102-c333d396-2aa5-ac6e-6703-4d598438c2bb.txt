This image shows a painted miniature figure from Kingdom Death: Monster - appears to be a character with blue skin wearing medieval-style clothing, holding what looks like a stringed instrument (possibly a lute or similar) and has a smoking pipe. The figure is mounted on a textured circular base. This appears to be a purely decorative miniature with no visible text, cards, or game statistics shown.
