This image shows two beautifully painted miniature figurines against a black background - one appears to be an armored warrior character with ornate details in blue and green colors standing on a textured base, and the other appears to be a spherical creature or object with carved face-like features in brown/bronze tones. While these are clearly Kingdom Death: Monster game pieces, there is no visible text, card information, rules, or other readable content in this image. This appears to be a showcase photograph highlighting the miniature painting and sculpting work.
