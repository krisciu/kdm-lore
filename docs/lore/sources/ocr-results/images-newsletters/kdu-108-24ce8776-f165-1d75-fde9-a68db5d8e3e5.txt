Looking at this image, I can see it shows a Kingdom Death: Monster figure/miniature with what appears to be artwork or a card in the background. However, the text in the image is not clearly legible enough for me to accurately transcribe specific words, card names, or game mechanics.

I can make out that there appears to be some text at the top of the artwork/card that might say "KINGDOM" and "DEATH" but I cannot be certain of the exact spelling or read any other text elements clearly enough to provide an accurate transcription.

[Text present but not clearly legible for accurate transcription]
