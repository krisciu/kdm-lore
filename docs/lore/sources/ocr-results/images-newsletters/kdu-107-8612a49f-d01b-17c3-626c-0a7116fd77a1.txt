Looking at this Kingdom Death: Monster newsletter image, I can see it's primarily artwork showing various characters in an action scene. However, I can only make out a partial watermark or signature in the lower right area that appears to say something like "FLOWER" but the text is not clearly legible.

[No clearly readable text found - this appears to be primarily promotional artwork with only faint watermark text that is not clearly legible]
