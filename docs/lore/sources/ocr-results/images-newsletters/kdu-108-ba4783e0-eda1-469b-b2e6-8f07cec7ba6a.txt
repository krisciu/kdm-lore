Looking at this image, I can see a black box that appears to be the Kingdom Death: Monster game box sitting on a wooden surface. 

The visible text I can extract is:

**KINGDOM DEATH**
**MONSTER**

There appears to be a white decorative design/logo on the top of the box that looks like a stylized creature or emblem, but any additional text within or around that design is not clearly legible in this image.

The box appears to be photographed at an angle on what looks like a wooden table or surface with white walls in the background.
