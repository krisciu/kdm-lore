This image shows three painted miniature figures from Kingdom Death: Monster displayed on golden pedestals against a black background. The figures appear to be the same character shown from different angles (back, front, and side views). The character has white/silver hair with animal ears, is wearing blue and brown/leather armor with fur trim, and has a long segmented tail. While this is clearly Kingdom Death: Monster content, there is no visible text, card information, rules, or other written content in this image - it appears to be a showcase photograph of painted miniatures.
