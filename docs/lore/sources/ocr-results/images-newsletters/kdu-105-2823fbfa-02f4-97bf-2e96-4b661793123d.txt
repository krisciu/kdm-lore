This appears to be a promotional or artistic image showing a painted miniature figure from Kingdom Death: Monster. The image shows a female warrior character with wings, holding a sword, positioned on a base decorated with skulls and bones. There is a logo visible in the top left corner, but no readable text content, card information, rules, or game mechanics are present in this image. This appears to be a showcase/gallery image of a painted miniature rather than a card or rules content.
