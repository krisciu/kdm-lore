This appears to be a promotional or showcase image of a painted miniature figure from Kingdom Death: Monster. The image shows a detailed miniature of a female character in gothic/dark fantasy styling, but contains no visible text, card information, rules, or other readable content to extract. It appears to be purely a display image of the painted model against a black background with what looks like a logo in the upper left corner.
