This image shows a detailed miniature figure from Kingdom Death: Monster, but it appears to be a product photograph or promotional image of the painted model itself rather than a game card or rules text. The figure depicts an ornate, robed character with tentacles and appears to be a high-quality painted miniature, but there is no visible game text, card information, or readable text elements in the image.
