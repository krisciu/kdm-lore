This image shows a beautifully painted miniature figure from Kingdom Death: Monster, featuring what appears to be a character with long white hair and beard, wearing red robes with gold trim, and wielding a green and white striped staff or weapon. There are green spectral or flame-like effects emanating from the figure. However, there is no visible text, card information, rules text, or other readable content in this image - it appears to be purely a showcase photograph of a painted game miniature against a dark background.
