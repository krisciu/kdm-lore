Looking at this image, I can see:

**RG**

**Rare Gear**

This appears to be a card back or decorative cover for the "Rare Gear" category in Kingdom Death: Monster. The image has an ornate, vintage-style design with decorative flourishes and scrollwork in green/olive tones, but contains no additional game text, rules, or mechanics beyond the title and category designation.
