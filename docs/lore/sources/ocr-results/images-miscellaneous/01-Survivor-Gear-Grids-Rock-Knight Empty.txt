**Rock Knight**

[This appears to be a 3x3 grid of identical cards or tiles, each showing only the letter "G" in the center. The cards appear to be face-down or showing only a basic identifier, with no other visible text, rules, or flavor content beyond the title "Rock Knight" at the top of the image.]
