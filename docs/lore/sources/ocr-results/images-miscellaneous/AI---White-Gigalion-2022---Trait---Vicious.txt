*At the end of each monster turn, the monster gets low to the ground preparing to dash away.*

Target all adjacent survivors. Full move the monster (even if there are no targets) away from all other threats. All targets suffer **Grab**.

**Grab:** Place target knocked down in front of the monster (or in the closest unoccupied space, if impossible). They suffer ⭐ damage to a random hit location.
