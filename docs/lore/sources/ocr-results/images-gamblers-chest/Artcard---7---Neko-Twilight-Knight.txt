This appears to be artwork/illustration of the Twilight Knight character from Kingdom Death: Monster. The image shows a female figure in dark armor with cat-like ears, holding a sword and lantern, with skull decorations and a dark atmospheric background. However, there is no visible game text, rules, statistics, or other readable content in this image - it appears to be purely artistic/illustrative in nature.
