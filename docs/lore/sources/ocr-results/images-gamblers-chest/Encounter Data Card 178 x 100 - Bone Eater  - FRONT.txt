|-------|----------|---------|---------|

⚠️ **Reminder!**
During the monster's turn, all encounter monsters perform their Basic Action, one at a time, in order of initiative cards.

---

**Counter Condition**
At the end of your attack, unless you are in the Bone Eater's blind spot, it draws a counter card.

---

**Instinct: Attune**

*The Bone Eater tenses every muscle fiber in its body and emits a loud and pleasant note from deep within its throat.* It becomes **Toned**.

**Toned:** While a Bone Eater is toned, it suffers -3 movement and gains +3 damage. After performing its Basic Action (including any drawn opportunity cards), the Bone Eater is no longer toned. Track this by placing a toned token (black lantern token) under the monster.
