Looking at this artistic illustration from Kingdom Death: Monster, I can see it depicts a character with dark hair wielding weapons alongside what appears to be a large cat-like creature, with monster-like beings in the background. However, I cannot make out any clearly readable text, card names, rules text, flavor text, or game statistics in this image.

The image appears to be concept art or an illustration rather than a game card with text elements.
