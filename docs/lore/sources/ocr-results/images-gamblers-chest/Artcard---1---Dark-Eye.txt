This appears to be a pencil sketch/artwork showing an anime-style character with long flowing hair holding what appears to be a staff or weapon. While this may be related to Kingdom Death: Monster, I cannot make out any readable text, card titles, rules text, or other game information from this image. The image appears to be primarily artistic in nature without visible text elements.
