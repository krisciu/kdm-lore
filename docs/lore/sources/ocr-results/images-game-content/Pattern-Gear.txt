Looking at this image, I can see it appears to be a card back or decorative pattern rather than a game card with readable text content. 

The only visible text elements are:
- **-008** (appears to be a card number or identifier)
- **Pattern Gear** (appears to be a category or type designation)

The rest of the image consists of ornate decorative flourishes and baroque-style ornamental patterns in white/silver against a gray background, which appears to be the standard card back design for Kingdom Death: Monster gear cards.

[This appears to be a card back with minimal identifying text]
