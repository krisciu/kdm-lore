Looking at this image, I can see it appears to be a card back or cover page with minimal text content.

The only visible text I can clearly make out is:

**(M) UNIVERSAL CARDS**

This appears to be printed vertically along the right edge of what looks like a black or very dark card back/cover design.

The rest of the image appears to be a solid dark background without any other readable text content.
