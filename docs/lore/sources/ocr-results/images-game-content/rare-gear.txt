Looking at this image, I can see this is a decorative card back or cover page with ornate baroque-style flourishes and designs in green/olive tones.

The only visible text is:

**RG**

**Rare Gear**

This appears to be the back of a Rare Gear card from Kingdom Death: Monster, featuring decorative scrollwork and ornamental borders but no gameplay text or mechanics.
