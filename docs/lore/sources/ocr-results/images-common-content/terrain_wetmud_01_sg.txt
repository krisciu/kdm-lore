[No text found]

This appears to be a black and white abstract or artistic image with dark ink-like splotches and stains against a light background. I cannot discern any readable text, card titles, game mechanics, or other textual content in this image. The image appears to be either decorative artwork or possibly a heavily stylized/artistic element from the game rather than a text-bearing game component.
