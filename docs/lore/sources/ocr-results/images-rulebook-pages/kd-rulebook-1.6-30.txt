# First Story: White Lion

## 1 Create the White Lion AI Deck
The White Lion AI deck controls the monster's actions. The First Story White Lion has a predetermined deck. In future showdowns, you will use the expanded mood rules to randomize AI decks.

AI cards have ranks, denoted by a symbol in the top right corner: Basic, Advanced, and Legendary. Additional types of cards will be used later.

Select the following from the White Lion AI cards:

**B Basic**
- 1x Claw
- 1x Chomp
- 1x Size Up
- 1x Power Swat
- 1x Grasp

**A Advanced**
- 1x Maul
- 1x Terrifying Roar
- 1x Enraged

**L Legendary**
- none

Set **Claw** aside and shuffle the remaining cards. Place them in a stack face down on the monster control panel in the area for the AI deck. Place **Claw** face down on the top of the AI deck.

Each type of monster card has a unique card back

**AI** - Artificial Intelligence
**H** - Hit Locations  
**R** - White Lion Resources

# SHOWDOWN SETUP

## 2 Set Up White Lion Hit Location Deck
Hit location cards are used to determine where the White Lion is hit when it is attacked. Take the White Lion's hit location cards and set aside **Strange Hand**. Shuffle the remaining cards and place them in a stack face down on the monster control panel in the area for the Hit Location deck. Place **Strange Hand** face down on top of the Hit Location deck.

## 3 Set Up White Lion's Basic Action
Place the double-sided **Basic Action / Monster Reference** card on the monster control panel. The First Story White Lion's attributes are listed on one side and its Basic Action on the other.

## 4 Set Up the Showdown Table
Place the showdown board in the play area. Arrange the survivors' record sheets and gear grids so they are accessible to the players.

## 5 Place the Miniatures on the Board
Place the White Lion miniature at the center of the showdown board. Each player places their survivor miniature anywhere 8 spaces away from the White Lion miniature (counted cardinally, not diagonally). See blue squares in diagram above.

*If a player quits their survivor dies, the remaining players choose a new Monster Controller. The Monster Controller targets their own survivor.*

**Claw**

*claw attack. Quick: A basic attack on range*
