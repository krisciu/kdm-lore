**Name:** The name of the Innovation.

**Keywords:** Innovations have a type (Paint's type is art) and an origin (Paint is a *language consequence*).

**Rules:** Some innovations, like Language, have persistent benefits. Others will allow you to endeavor at these innovations for potential gain.

If an endeavor cost is listed, one or more players may nominate a survivor, spend their endeavors at this innovation, and apply any resulting rules.

**Consequences:** Some innovations direct you to add further innovations to the innovation deck.

**The Innovation Deck**
A settlement's innovation deck is a persistent deck that grows during the campaign. It represents the potential cultural and technological growth of your settlement, and will grow as a consequence of gained innovation cards.

Whenever your settlement gains a new innovation, search the innovation cards for all innovations that are a *consequence* of the new innovation. Shuffle them into the innovation deck.

The innovation deck is persistent. Make sure to preserve the unique combination of cards in your deck between play sessions.

The starting innovation deck of a new settlement arises from the first innovation, **Language**, which is gained from the **First Day** settlement event. It consists of the 6 innovations marked *language consequence*: Paint, Ingredients, Drums, Ammonia, Symposium, and Hovel.

**Adding Innovations**
When a new innovation is added to your settlement, place it in the play area with all other innovations and update your Settlement Record Sheet innovation list.

**Survival Limit**
Some innovations change your settlement's Survival Limit. When these are innovated, increase the Survival Limit on the Settlement Record Sheet. If these innovations are lost, decrease the Survival Limit.

Place any unused gear in the allotted space in the game box. Retrieve these cards in future settlement phases. (Players can keep a written gear list.)

Finish cleaning the play area by returning the settlement's locations, event cards, and unused survivor record sheets to the game box.

**Weapon Masteries**

Weapon masteries are innovations, they are permanently added to the list of settlement innovations.

When any survivor attains a weapon mastery with a weapon type, that mastery imparts benefits to everyone in the settlement. All other survivors automatically gain the **Specialist** bonus for that weapon type and may use this in addition to whatever weapon proficiencies they have earned.

**Principles**

Principles are the guiding philosophies of your settlement. They have two components, a story event and a principle card.

When a principle's story event is triggered, it will prompt your settlement to make a choice. Follow the rules on each story event. Record the chosen principle on the Settlement Record Sheet and add that principle's card to the settlement play area.

Principle cards describe persistent effects of your chosen principles. Apply any benefits of your principle as survivors are born, when they die, and at any other appropriate time.

**Settlement Locations**

The majority of a settlement's resources are spent at settlement locations. At the start of the campaign, survivors have one settlement location—the **Lantern Hoard**. Additional locations are added to the settlement from existing settlement locations and from story events.
