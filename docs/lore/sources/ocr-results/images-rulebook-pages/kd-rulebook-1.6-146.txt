# **LEGENDARY MONSTERS**

Legendary monsters are the survivors' ultimate quarry. Make sure to read and follow each monster's setup instructions carefully. They are set up like their counterparts at Lv1 3 and under, with a few exceptions:

**Life Trait:** Legendary monsters use the **Life** trait. Full rules for Life are found in the Monster Section.

**Hit Locations:** Use the hit location deck associated with each legendary monster's species but archive all hit locations listed in the special instructions before the showdown begins.

**Trait Cards:** Legendary monsters combine trait cards from multiple AI Decks. Remember to resolve any conflicts that arise from the rules with the Rule of Death.

**Once per Campaign:** Each legendary monster may only be defeated once per campaign. They are singular, special monsters.
