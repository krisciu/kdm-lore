Looking at this manga-style comic page, I can see several sound effects and onomatopoeia in Japanese style:

- **ドキドキ** (in the top left panel)
- **ズシャアアア** (in the top middle panel showing what appears to be an explosion or impact)
- **ギャア** (in the top right panel)
- **アアアア** (in the left middle panel)
- Various other Japanese sound effects scattered throughout the panels including **ゴゴゴ** and similar onomatopoeia

The image appears to be from a manga or comic showing dramatic action scenes with characters in distress or combat situations. The text is primarily Japanese sound effects and exclamations rather than dialogue or narrative text.

[Note: This appears to be a manga page rather than a Kingdom Death: Monster rulebook image as initially suggested in the prompt]
