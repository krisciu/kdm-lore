This appears to be a purely artistic illustration from Kingdom Death: Monster showing a dark, atmospheric scene with figures in combat against demonic or monstrous creatures. The image contains no visible text, card names, rules, or other readable game content - it appears to be decorative artwork or possibly a card back/splash page illustration.
