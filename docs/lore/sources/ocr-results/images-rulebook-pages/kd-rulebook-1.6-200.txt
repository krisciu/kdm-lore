Looking at this manga-style comic page, I can extract the following text:

**Sound Effects:**
- TAK TAK (appears multiple times)
- HA (speech/breathing sound)

The image appears to be from a black and white manga or comic showing action sequences with a character moving through what looks like a rocky or cave-like environment. The text is minimal, consisting primarily of onomatopoeia (sound effects) typical of manga formatting.

The "TAK TAK" sounds appear to represent footsteps or movement sounds, while "HA" likely represents breathing or exertion from the character.
