Looking at this manga-style comic page, I can see several sound effects and onomatopoeia in Japanese characters, but the text is quite stylized and integrated into the action scenes. The visible text elements appear to be:

**Sound Effects/Onomatopoeia:**
- Various Japanese sound effect characters scattered throughout the panels
- Action lines and movement indicators typical of manga art style

The image appears to be from a manga or comic book rather than a Kingdom Death: Monster rulebook. The art style shows dynamic action sequences with characters in combat, but the text is primarily consisting of Japanese sound effects that are integrated into the artwork rather than readable rules text or game mechanics.

Most of the text visible consists of stylized sound effects that are part of the artistic composition rather than extractable game content or rules text.
