**Create a Survivor**

**Gear Grid and Starting Gear**
Each player uses a gear grid to arrange the gear their survivor currently has. Starting survivors begin with 1 Cloth armor gear card and 1 Founding Stone weapon gear card. Place these two cards right-side up in any two boxes on your gear grid.

The left side of the gear grid has a reference area describing the survivor's turn, spending survival, and fighting bare-handed with Fist & Tooth.

**Survivor Record Sheets**
Use a survivor record sheet for each survivor. The record sheet maintains vital information about a survivor's life.

Pencils and erasers are recommended for record sheets, as you will change them often. Fortune is fleeting, after all.

Only the survivor characteristics vital for a starting survivor's first showdown are discussed below. Complete rules can be found in the Survivors section of this rulebook.

**Name Your Survivor**
Name your survivor in the space provided. Your survivor gains a survival and hunting a name. Add "1" to the record sheet in the box labeled Survival.

**Learn about Survival**
Survival represents the desperate desire to cling to life. In the First Story, survival can only be spent to dodge.

As you play, you will gain up to four more life-saving survival actions: dash, encourage, surge, and endure.

When survival is spent, decrease the number in the Survival box by 1. Survival does not automatically replenish and must be earned through gameplay.

**Learn About Attributes**
Survivors' attributes describe their advantages or disadvantages. Except for movement, attributes start at zero. While most won't be used during the First Story, all attributes are listed below.

**Movement (5):** the number of spaces a survivor can move each turn.
**Speed (0):** attack rate
**Accuracy (0):** attack precision
**Strength (0):** attack power
