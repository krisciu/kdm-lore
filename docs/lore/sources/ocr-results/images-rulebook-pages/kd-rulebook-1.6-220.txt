Looking at this manga-style comic page, I can extract the following visible text:

**Sound Effects:**
- AH
- AAA
- AH

[The image appears to be a black and white manga page showing dramatic scenes with characters in distress. The main visible text consists of exclamatory sound effects/screams. The artwork depicts what appears to be bodies or figures scattered across a battlefield or tragic scene, with a character observing from above. The style is consistent with dark fantasy manga artwork that might be found in Kingdom Death: Monster materials, but the actual readable text content is limited to these vocal expressions/sound effects.]
