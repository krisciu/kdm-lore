Looking at this manga-style comic panel, I can see some sound effects and onomatopoeia, but the text is quite difficult to read clearly due to the artistic style and image quality. 

The visible text appears to be:

**Sound Effects:**
- "HA" (repeated multiple times)
- Some additional sound effects that are partially obscured or stylized

The image shows what appears to be a horror/action scene with a character on the left side and some kind of monster or creature on the right, along with smaller panels below. However, most of the text consists of Japanese-style sound effects and onomatopoeia rather than readable English text with game rules or descriptions.

Due to the artistic manga style and image quality, I cannot make out any clear rulebook text, card names, or game mechanics that would typically be found in a Kingdom Death: Monster rulebook page.
