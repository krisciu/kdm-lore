**HAMMER AND NAIL**
*- Finale -*

*You pour all of your might into resisting the unstoppable strike, your fingernails peel backwards and hair grows downwards back into your scalp.*

You must **Bend or Break**.

**Bend or Break** - roll 1d10

**1 2 3 4**

Your body cannot withstand the immense pressure. You are driven into ground, your legs crumpling.

You are knocked down, suffer the dismembered leg severe injury and archive your **Thunder Maul**.

**5 6 7 8**

Your weapon collides with the Gold Smoke Knight's, sending a cloud of dust and stone faces careening in all directions. Your lion-faced maul meets its match, but your body is found wanting. You manage to deflect the blow, but shatter in the process.

Suffer the **broken arm** severe injury.

Cancel the monster's **Blacken** action.

**9 10**

You search within for strength, falling deeper and deeper into your subconscious. You see yourself from the inside out. Visceral bloody machinery slow to a crawl as time drags. Electricity crackles from your brain, supercharging your heart. Muscles bulge with lightning speed as your swing generates a sonic boom. Everything shatters.

Suffer the **frenzy brain** trauma four times. Destroy all armor at all hit locations. Gain the **Immortal** disorder. Cancel the monster's **Blacken** action.
