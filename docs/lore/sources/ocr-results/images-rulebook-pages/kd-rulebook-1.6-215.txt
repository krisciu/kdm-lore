Looking at this manga-style comic page, I can extract the following visible text:

**Sound Effects and Onomatopoeia:**
- ERKK
- CHEW
- CHEW
- CHEW

**Dialogue/Exclamations:**
- Various Japanese-style exclamations and speech bubbles with symbols like "!" and "?" 
- "HA!"
- "LUUV"

The image appears to be from a manga or comic depicting some kind of intense scene with characters in distress or conflict. Most of the text consists of sound effects and brief exclamations rather than substantial dialogue or narrative text. The artistic style is typical of Japanese manga with detailed black and white illustrations.
