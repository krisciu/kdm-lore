**WATCHED**

*Dark spots spread across the lantern hoard. A nervous hush falls over the settlement. Slowly, the most daring survivors peer past the darkened lanterns, venturing beneath them into a vast chamber, unknown and undreamed of. Slumbering in the center of the chamber, the survivors can feel a presence of immense danger. Their ultimate predator would soon wake, extinguishing the lantern light that holds the endless darkness at bay.*

Starting with this settlement phase, the survivors may awaken and face the sleeping menace. You may move **X Nemesis Encounter - Watcher** to the current lantern year. You cannot move it to a year that already has a Nemesis Encounter on the timeline.

The settlements have a different response to the discovery based on their **Conviction**.

**Barbaric Response**

The survivors decide they must craft the perfect weapon to prepare themselves. Gain the **Ultimate Weapon Innovation**. This does not count towards your settlement's innovation total. Nominate a survivor and roll 1d10.

◆◆◆◆◆

The survivor begins to make preparations. Add **Hands of Heat** to the timeline 4 years from now.

◇◇◇◇◇

The survivor silently decides they are the true hero. They gain +10 insanity, and the **Quixotic** disorder.

**Romantic Response**

The survivors decide they must learn the perfect fighting art to prepare themselves. Gain the **Final Fighting Art Innovation**. This does not count towards your settlement's innovation total. Nominate a survivor and roll 1d10.

◆◆◆◆◆

Without saying a word, the survivor runs into the darkness, never to be found again. Add **Bone Witch** to the timeline 4 years from now.

◇◇◇◇◇

The survivor bursts into an unhealthy laughter. They gain +10 insanity, +1 permanent strength, and the **Immortal** disorder.
