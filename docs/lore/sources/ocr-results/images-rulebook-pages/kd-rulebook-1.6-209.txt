Looking at this manga-style comic page, I can see several sound effects and dialogue elements:

**Sound Effects:**
- **LUNN** (appears twice in the top panel)

**Dialogue:**
- **HA** (appears in speech bubbles in the bottom right panels)

The image appears to be from a manga or comic book showing dramatic action scenes with a character amid what looks like destruction or intense weather/environmental effects. The text is minimal, consisting mainly of sound effects and brief exclamations typical of manga formatting.

Most of the speech bubbles contain Japanese characters that are not clearly legible in this image quality, so I've only transcribed the clearly visible romanized text elements.
