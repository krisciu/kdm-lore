This appears to be a purely artistic illustration from Kingdom Death: Monster showing a dramatic scene with a large monster creature consuming or attacking human figures. The image contains no visible text, card names, rules, or other readable content - it appears to be artwork that would accompany game content rather than containing game mechanics itself.
