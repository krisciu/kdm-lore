Looking at this manga-style comic page, I can extract the following visible text:

**Sound Effects:**
- TAK (appears multiple times)
- HA
- AU!
- ERK
- FUU...

**Speech/Dialogue:**
- Various Japanese onomatopoeia and sound effects scattered throughout the panels

This appears to be a page from a manga or comic book showing what looks like an action or dramatic sequence with a female character. The text is primarily sound effects and brief exclamations rather than substantial dialogue or narrative text. The artwork is done in black and white with detailed shading and multiple panel layouts typical of manga style.
