# **Attributes**

Survivors and monsters may gain permanent increases or decreases to their attributes.

If a survivor's attributes are permanently affected, update the appropriate box on the survivor record sheet to reflect changes. All survivor attributes have a box with a space to pencil in the values of these attributes.

If a survivor gains temporary modifiers to their attributes, place tokens on the record sheet instead of changing the sheet. Remove these tokens at the end of the showdown.

If a monster's attributes change, place attribute modifier tokens on the monster control panel.

**Be sure to consider attribute changes when monsters and survivors attack.**

## **How Movement Works**
A starting survivor's movement is 5, meaning they may move up to 5 adjacent unoccupied spaces each turn, counted cardinally not diagonally.

## **Survivor Hit Locations**
Survivors have 5 hit locations vulnerable to damage and capable of wearing protective armor: **Head, Arms, Body, Waist, and Legs.**
Hit locations have light and heavy injury levels (light and heavy-lined boxes).

---

## **Armor Points**
The Cloth starting gear card provides 1 armor point at the waist location (indicated by a +1 in the shield accompanied by the waist symbol at the top left of the card). Record "1" in the shield-shaped space next to Waist on your survivor record sheet to represent the armor points gained from the **Cloth**.

## **Brain and Insanity**
The Brain location is a survivor's mental fitness. The fragile Brain has only one injury level. Instead of armor, survivors use insanity to shield their brains.

Only **brain damage** harms the Brain location. Actions that cause brain damage are clearly marked. When suffering brain damage, insanity protects the Brain the same way armor protects hit locations.

**Insanity** keeps survivors steadfast in the face of a roaring, toothy maw that would bring a sane person to their knees. **Insanity is persistent, and is gained and lost through gameplay.**

---

## **Check Your Weapons**
A starting survivor has two available weapons — the **Founding Stone** and **Fist & Tooth**. The rules for the **Founding Stone** can be found on the **Founding Stone** gear card and the rules for **Fist & Tooth** can be found on the left side of the gear grid, along with useful reference information for survivors.

Each weapon has attack attributes that determine the outcome of a survivor's attack. Details about making attacks follow later in this section.

The survivors' **Founding Stones** have a special ability (on the bottom right of the gear card). Instead of attacking the monster with the **Founding Stone** in hand, survivors may throw it at a monster from anywhere on the showdown board, causing an automatic critical wound. Afterwards, the **Founding Stone** is lost forever and archived (returned to the game box).
