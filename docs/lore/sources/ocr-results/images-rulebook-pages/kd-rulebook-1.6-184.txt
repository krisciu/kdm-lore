This appears to be an artwork/illustration image from Kingdom Death: Monster showing two female figures in a dramatic scene, but I cannot detect any readable text, card names, rules text, or other game mechanics visible in this image. The image appears to be purely artistic/decorative content without any text overlay or game information.
