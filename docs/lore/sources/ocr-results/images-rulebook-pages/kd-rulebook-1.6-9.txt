Looking at this Kingdom Death: Monster rulebook page, I can extract the following text:

*Once upon a time, there was a place of carved stone faces. A man with a lantern lay sleeping a dreamless sleep. The man knew nothing.*

**Kingdom Death: Monster Core Game 5**

The page features an ornate decorative initial letter "O" with elaborate medieval-style illumination and scrollwork designs. This appears to be the beginning of a story or lore section from the game.
