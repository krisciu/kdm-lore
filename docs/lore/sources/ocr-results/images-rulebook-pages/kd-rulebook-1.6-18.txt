This appears to be a purely artistic/decorative image from Kingdom Death: Monster showing a dramatic scene with a character with white/silver hair in the foreground and what appears to be a menacing creature with glowing red eyes in the background. The image has an atmospheric, apocalyptic feel with warm orange/yellow lighting in the foreground contrasting with dark, stormy skies. There is no visible text, rules, or game mechanics present in this illustration.
