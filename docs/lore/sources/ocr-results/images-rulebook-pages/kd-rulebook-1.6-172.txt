This appears to be a purely artistic illustration from Kingdom Death: Monster showing a large, intimidating armored figure (likely the Watcher or similar entity) seated among skulls and bones in a hellish landscape, with a distressed figure visible in the background. The image contains no visible text, card titles, rules, or other readable game content - it appears to be concept art or atmospheric artwork from the game.
