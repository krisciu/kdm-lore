Looking at this manga-style comic page, I can see some sound effects and minimal text:

**Sound Effects:**
- **AH** (in top right panel)
- **KA KA** (in bottom left panel)
- **AH** (in bottom right panel)

The image appears to be a dramatic sequence showing a character in what looks like a threatening or dangerous situation, with most of the storytelling being conveyed through the artwork rather than text. The panels show various close-up shots and what appears to be some kind of creature or monster with fur or feathers.

[Most content is visual storytelling with minimal text - primarily sound effects in Japanese manga style]
