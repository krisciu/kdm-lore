**Survivors' Turn!**
Each turn, every survivor has an act. Each survivor takes their acts one at a time. There is no set order. Players should decide their order strategically. After all players acts are finished, the round is over and it becomes the monster's turn again.

**Survivor Act**
When a survivor takes their act, they gain 1 movement ❶ and 1 activation ❷. These can be spent in any order and are not cumulative from act to act. Each movement and activation must be completed before another can begin. When a survivor finishes their act, they lose any unused ❶❷ before another survivor may begin their act.

**Survivor Movement**
When a survivor spends their movement ❶, they can move up to their movement attribute (5), one board space at a time to any unoccupied, adjacent, non-diagonal space.

A survivor cannot divide their movement into multiple parts. They cannot move 2 spaces, spend an activation, then resume their movement and move another 3 spaces.

**Move a survivor adjacent to the White Lion to attack.**

**Survivor Activation**
Survivors spend their activation ❷ to attack with the Foundling Stone or sling it by following the special rule at the bottom of the card. When an activation is resolved, it will be denoted by ❷.

**Attack with the Foundling Stone**
Starting survivors have two weapons: **Foundling Stone** and **Fist & Tooth**. Each weapon has 3 attack attributes: speed, accuracy, and strength. Once adjacent to the monster, spend your ❷ to attack with the **Foundling Stone**!

**Make Attack Rolls**
Speed determines the number of attack rolls. This represents how quickly you strike. The Foundling Stone's speed is 2. Roll 2d10 to attack.

**Count the Number of Hits**
Accuracy is the number each attack roll must meet or exceed to hit. The Foundling Stone's accuracy is 7. Every attack roll result of 7 or greater is a hit! If there were no hits, the attacker misses and their attack ends. Survivors attacking from a monster's blind spot are at an advantage, and gain +1 to the results of their attack rolls. In the blind spot, an attack roll of 6 with a Foundling Stone becomes 7, making this result a hit.

**Draw Hit Locations**
Draw 1 hit location card for each hit. Select what order to try to wound them in. Attempt to wound each hit location one at a time.
