Looking at this black and white illustration, I can see what appears to be a landscape filled with skulls and a monument or pillar in the background. However, I cannot make out any clearly readable text in this image. The artistic style suggests this is from Kingdom Death: Monster artwork, but any text that might be present is either too small, stylized, or obscured by the artistic elements to be legibly extracted.

[No clearly readable text found]
