This appears to be a purely artistic illustration from Kingdom Death: Monster showing a dramatic scene with figures in flowing robes amid lightning and storm clouds. The image is rendered in a distinctive Japanese art style with muted colors (grays, purples, and blues) but contains no visible text, card names, rules, or other readable content to extract.
