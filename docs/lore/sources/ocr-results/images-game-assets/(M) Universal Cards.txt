Looking at this image, I can see it appears to be a card back or cover with a solid black background. The only visible text is:

**(M) UNIVERSAL CARDS**

This text appears vertically along the right edge in white lettering.

This appears to be the back or cover of a set of universal cards from Kingdom Death: Monster, with no other readable content visible.
