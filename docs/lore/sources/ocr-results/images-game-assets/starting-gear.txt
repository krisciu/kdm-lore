Looking at this image, I can see it appears to be a decorative card back or cover page with ornate baroque-style flourishes and designs.

The only clearly visible text is:

**SG**

**Starting Gear**

This appears to be the back/cover of a Starting Gear card set or section from Kingdom Death: Monster, featuring elegant decorative scrollwork and ornamental designs in a gray/silver color scheme against a light background.
