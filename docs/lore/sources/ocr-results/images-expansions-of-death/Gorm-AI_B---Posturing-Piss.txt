**Posturing Piss**

**Mood**

When this comes into play, draw **A**.

---

*The Gorm asserts its dominance over the challenging survivor.*

When a survivor ends their act in the Gorm's blind spot, if they have any armor points at the legs location, reduce them to zero. Otherwise, they suffer ★ damage to that location.

If the Gorm is defeated when this card is in play, if they have not innovated it yet, the settlement gains the **Ammonia innovation**.
