Looking at this image, I can see it appears to be a card back or decorative cover page for Kingdom Death: Monster gear cards. The visible text is:

**Flower Knight Gear**

The rest of the image consists of ornate decorative flourishes and scrollwork in a gothic/baroque style typical of Kingdom Death: Monster's aesthetic, but contains no other readable text content.

This appears to be either a card back design or a section divider/cover page rather than an actual gear card with game mechanics.
