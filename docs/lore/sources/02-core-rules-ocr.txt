Campaign-Based Game
Mons1eris played as a campaign , a continuous game
th ar lasts over severa l play sessi ons . It starts with the
F1rs1 Srory an d onds with a final showdown against
rho Watcher
This is not moant to happon ,n one sitting. Each
limo you play , you will hunt monsters, gather resourc -
es, and develop your settlemen t while fending off new
throats
A typ ical session includes ono cycle of game
phases Hunt. Showdown, and Setrlement. Survivors

teamwork of every group of players.
Monster is a fully cooperative game. The g_roup
plays against the game. Players control survivors
individually and take turns controlling monsters. In
each phase of the game , players will rely on e~ch
other to make critical decisions about everything
from battle tactics lo civ1l1zation expansion .
The game w,11 prompt players to make decisions as
monster controllers , event revealers , or resource
spenders. Players can approach these decisions in-
dividually, as a group, or even elect leadership.
Your settlement's resources are a crucial ex-
ample of group dec1s1on-making. It is up the players
to decide whether or not they pool their resources,
spending them as a group or split them and spend
them individually.There is no right way to make a
group decision.
Miniature Generations
Over the course of your campaign, surv_; vors wilt die,
new ones will be born, and others will profoundly
change over time.
survivors that endure multiple hunts will be re-
warded with increases to their attributes, new abili-
ties, and bonuses. Others will suffer attribute losses,
permanent disfigurements, and crippling physical
and mental afflictions.
Players will take the roles of multiple survivors
throughout the campaign. The survivors' settlement
is the enduring element that must persevere.
Players will create new survivors as old survi-
vors perish. They may also create multiple living sur-
vivors to use depending on circumstances and the
challenges presented to them.
The same players need not control the same
survivors between play sessions. The survivors in a
settlement can be treated as a common pool that dif-
ferent groups of players can use.
Just as survivors come and go, so can the play-
ers within the campaign.

Settlement Phase
Survivors establish their settlement at a strange
source of light and safety. During the Settlement
Phase, they will use their gathered resources to de-
velop this small haven. Players must work together
to ready their settlement for the final confrontation
with the Watcher.
As you fight new monsters and make new dis-
coveries, you will build new settlement locations,
craft gear, add innovations to your society, and de-
termine its guiding principles.
Players are encouraged to experiment, imple-
ment votes, assign roles, and find new ways to gov-
ern your settlement.
The Settlement Phase is a great place to start and
end your game sessions. After survivors return from
battle, players develop their settlement and spend
resources before a new group sets off. Update the
record of what you've earned so that you are ready
to hunt when you return to the game.
Hunt Phase
During the Hunt Phase a group of survivors departs
from the settlement to track their quarry through the
bizarre landscapes of Monster. The price of their
failure is grim: if the survivors perish or return emp-
ty-handed, the settlement will starve
Hunting takes place on the hunt board, which
acts as a stage for the chaotic events that befall the
survivors while in pursuit of a monster
Lethal risks and strange rewards await the
survivors on the hunt. Even the journey to the battle
can be potentially fatal.
When hunting the monster, players take turns guid-
ing the group through each event. Use this as an
opportunity to create suspense and surprise.
Read hunt events scenarios aloud without
revealing the possible outcomes. Decide how to
approach each situation, then make any rolls and
face any outcomes together.
Showdown Phase
-,.~
. ",( Y-\
£
~
Defeating monsters 1n the Showdown Phase 1s the
primary way of gathering resources, evolving survi-
vors, and passing lantern years.
The Showdown Phase 1s the longest phase of
the game, and requires the most in-depth coopera-
tive strategy
The showdown consists of a battle between the en-
tire group of survivors against a single monstrous
intelligence. Each showdown m Monster is unique.
Players take turns controlling the monster using a
pair of randomized decks that govern its behavior.
Monsters are also tough. Your group will utilize
all of its weapons, gear, innovations, and survivor
characteristics to their full potential to defeat each
new foe.

Throughout the game, you will roll dice to determine
the outcomes of everything from attacks to choosing
random players.
When the game instructs you to roll d10s, it re-
fers to the 10-sided dice included with the game. The
values on the dice are 1 to 1O (the 1O face is repre-
sented by a lantern).
The number of dice you need to roll is specified
by the number before "d1 O", so 2d10 is 2 dice.
If the game instructs you to roll a d5, roll a d 1O
and divide the result in half (rounded up).
Rolling on tables is an important component
of the game, introducing an element of chance to
events. Many moments in the game are accompa-
nied by a table , everything from determining the out-
comes of severe injuries to the results of story events
contains an element of chance.
Some tables are even affected by existing inno-
vations and principles the group has already chosen.
Rul!'S•
Lantern 10
Lantern 10 refers to a die roll result where the lantern
face Is showing. Natural 1 refers to a roll result where
the number "1'' face showing
During the showdown, it is possible to encounter
situations where It Is impossible to succeed or fail at
hitting or wounding. In such cases, Lantern 1O's al-
ways succeed and 1's always fail. This way, the pos-
sibility of success or failure exists, even in the most
one-sided circumstances.
For instance, players may find themselves fac-
ing monsters with toughness so high that the maxi-
mum die result (10) combined with their strength Is
not enough to penetrate the monster's toughness.
In this case, when a lantern 10 Is rolled, it will still
wound (and cause critical wounds, if luck allows).
Conversely, monsters may face situations
where an attack roll will always hit. For example, at-
tacking a survivor with negative evasion mght mean
it would hit on a 1 or higher. In these cases a natural
1 will still misses.
Conflicts and the Rule of Death
As in any game with many moving parts and rules,
confltct may occasionally anse regarding rules inter-
pretations, group decisions, or exceptions.
First and foremost, this game is designed to
provide time well spent with friends. Use this as the
guiding principle for solving any problems that arise.
In addition, here are some technical guidelines for
resolving confhct.
When conflict arises over contradictions in rules,
apply specific rules found on cards (Al , gear etc) and
story events, before any rules lound in the rulebook
core rules sections.
If confhcts arise that slow or halt a play ses-
sions completely, use the Rule of Death: always rule
against the survivors. Kingdom Death is a dangerous
place, and the survivors' future is bleak. Make sure
that any ambiguities resolve against the survivors'
favor.
At its core, Monster is a cooperative experience.
Be respectful of others as you navigate the game's
decisions together.

SURVIVORS
L1fo Is gnm
Each surv,vor has a record sheet that keeps track of
essenhal Informatron players will need to hunt, fight,
and interact with the settlement. Make sure to use a
pencil.
Survivor Miniatures
Players use miniatures to represent their survivors on
the hunt and showdown boards. Monster includes 4
starting survivor miniatures that represent the survi-
vors In their most primitive state.
Survivors change as they progress over lantern
years, gaining gear and losing limbs. Players are en-
couraged to build new miniatures of their survivors by
combining pieces from different armor sets to create a
miniature that represents their survivor's favorite gear
and personal story.
Survivor miniatures don 't need to accurately re-
flect the gear a player uses in the game . However, 11
your group decides to play this way, it is usually pos-
sible to do so. Survivor miniatures use 30 mm bases.

Survivor Basics
1 I Name
Naming your survivor gives them substance and a
conneclton to the player
2 I Survival
Survival Is the desperate desire to cling to hie.
Survival are gained and lost throughout the cam-
paign, and may be spent to perform extraordinary
feats and change your fate. When you name your
survivor, they gain + 1 survival. For a brand-new sur-
vivor, add a "1" In the survival box when you name
them.
As the amount of survival increases and de-
creases, update the survival box on your record
sheet.
Survival Limit
Survival Limit Is the maximum amount of survival any
survivor may have. Survival Limit is recorded on the
settlement record sheet and applies to all survivors.
Innovations and events will raise the settlement's
survival limit.
At the start of the campaign, the Survival Lurnt
is 1 . When the settlement innovates Language, the
Survival Limit is increased by 1 to 2. Any add1t1onal
survival gained over the Survival Limit Is lost
Survival
Survival may be spent to dash , dodge, encourage,
and surge. In the First Story, starting survivors can
only dodge.
Other survival actions are added as a result of adding
innovations to the settlement. When the settlement
innovates Language. Paint, and Inner Lantern.
survivors gain the ability to encourage dash , and
surge respectively As these become available 1n
your settlement. fill in the appropnate box on current
and new survivor record sheets
3 Survivor Attributes
Survivor attnbutes are used In the course of light-
ing monsters They include: movement, accuracy,
strength, evasion, luck, and speed
A survivor may gain permanent increases or de-
creases to their attnbutes Update the values in the
appropriate box on the record sheet to reflect these
changes
If a survivor gains temporary modifiers to their
attributes, place tokens on the record sheet instead
of changing the sheet. Remove these tokens al the
end of the showdown.

Courage and understanding will aid survivors
throughout the hunt and showdown . Some events
require levels of courage or understandi ng to partic-
ipate in them .
Courage is a survivor's potentially ill- adv i sed
bravery, and understanding is a survivor 's insight.
Courage and understanding have milestones (indi-

that milestone. They can only be triggered once in a

As survivors gain or suffer non-permanent changes
to their attributes, place the appropriate token on
their record sheet to mark these changes. All tokens
are removed at the end of each showdown.
Retirement
In rare instances, survivors retire, rather than perish.
When the last Hunt XP box is filled , the survivor re-
tires. A survivor may also be forced into early retire-
ment by some severe injuries
Retired survivors cannot hunt or participate in
showdowns.
When a survivor retires, they still contribute to
t~e total population of the settlement, and may par-
t1c1pate in settlement events and endeavors.

Gear Grid
The gear currently ,n a survivor's gear gnd ,s what
the survivor ,s wearing and carrying
The gear grid has space for 9 gear cards, which can
be arranged in any configuration as long as they are
faced nght-s1de up. They cannot be rotated.
Gear ,n gear gnds can only be rearranged during the
settlement phase.
Fist & Tooth
Fist & Tooth describes a survivor fighting with their
bare hands, and is a weapon available to all survi-
vors. Rules for Fist & Tooth are listed on the side of
the survivor gear grid and also below.
Duplicate Gear
Except for weapon s, a survivor may not have mul
t1ple copies of the same gear in their gear grid A
survivor gains the benefits of a weapon·s special
rules only once, no matter how many copies they
have. Additional copies of weapo ns still contribute
afftntt1es
Gear Keywords
Keywords are used to describe gear's important fea-
tures Gear keywords may be referenced by events,
monster cards, or other rules.
For example, the Bone Earrings item requires
survivors to only have bone gear In their gear grid
to gain its bonus. This refers to gear with the bone
keyword.
Gear Special Rules
Special rules are listed at the bottom of some gear
cards. These rules include special abilities and lim-
itations (e.g ., weapons can be Savage or Frail).
The rules of lower-level gear are explained on
their cards. However, rules on some higher-level
gear are referred to by name only. Full explanations
of all gear special rules can be found in the Glossary.
Armor Sets
A completed armor set will bestow the survivor with
a bonus hsted on an armor set card. Usually, armor

Activation Costs
Some gear require an add1t1onal cost from the survi-
vor in order to use them The most common cost as-
sociated with using a gear Is spending an activation,
but other costs-such as spending survival, or suffenng
damage-also appear on gear cards.
The Cat Gut Bow 1s Cumbersome, which re-
qu,res survivors to spend their movement action ,n
addition to an act1vat1on in order to be fired
Some gear functions differently if survivors are
insane, have a certain amount of survival, or meet at-

sp During the showdown , use attribute tokens to
indicate positive or negative changes to a monster's
movement, toughness , speed , damage , accuracy,
evasion, and luck. Attribute modifier tokens are dou -
ble-sided to show gains and losses for that attribute.
As the monster gains or suffers changes to its
attributes, place the appropriate token on the mon -
ster control panel to mark these changes .
Monsters and survivors share the following attri-
butes and tokens: movement , speed , accuracy, eva-
sion, and luck. With the exception of luck , they attect
monsters in the same way as survivors .
Luck To kens
Every positive monster luck token reduces the range
of wound roll results considered critical. Normal-
ly, the range of critical wounds is only lantern 1Os .
Unless the attackers have positive luck modifiers to
counteract it, a critical wound against a monster with
1 or more luck tokens is impossible. Every negative
monster luck token increases the attackers ' critical
wound range by 1.
The rule of la ntern 10 a l ways applies . Even if

ther actions on the Al card unless stated otherwi se .

Move & Attack Target Action
A Move & Attack Target attack action includes any
monster movement followed by an attack profile. This

Rules for attack effects are contained in a box below
the a!Ulck profile, and applied when the trigger occurs.
Persistent Injury A ctions
Persistent 1n1uries are conditional actions that replace
the normal rules of an Al card. Persistent injury ac-
tions on Al cards are only performed when the mon-
ster 1s suffering from its corresponding persistent inju-
ry . When a persistent injury action is performed, any
other actions on the card are ignored.
Intimi da te Actions
Intimidate actions hurt a survivor's mental well-being.
lnt1m1date actions most often cause brain damage but
can have further detrimental effects.
De fini tions

damage per monster level.

Monster resource cards are resources that are only
gained from fighting that type of monster. There are
separate decks of monster resource cards for all
hunt-able monsters (White Lion, Screaming Antelope ,
Phoenix).
Each monster resource has a resource type. For
instance, Lion Claw is a bone type resource.
_ Monster resources can be used and spent as
their resource type or as their specific resource name .
Some monster resources will have additional rules on
the bottom of their cards.

Life Trait

The life card is a unique trait card that Is used for en-
counters with some monsters and gameplay variants.
It represents a monster's life in place of its Al deck. A
pa ir of d1 O's should be placed in the marked spaces
using the dice faces to represent a numerical value.
Monsters with Life
When a monster has the 0 Life listed in its monster
characteristics it will be followed by a number . This
is the number of wounds the Life trait starts with. In-
stead of removing wounds by removing Al cards to
the wound stack, wound the monster by reducing the
number on the Life trait. When the number on Life is

Gameplay Variants
In th is rulebook, th e 5-6 Player variant uses the Life
trait.
In order to balance the encounter with additional sur-
vivors, monsters will gain th e Life trait in addition to
normal wounds tracked by their Al decks. To begin
moving Al cards to the wound stack, the survivors
must first reduce a monster's Life trait to 0.
Proxy Cards
There are 8 proxy cards included with the game, two
of each number. These cards can be used to replace
cards you've lost or when a gaming group decides to
customize their experience.

Vermin Resources
The fauna of Kingdom Death has a variety of small ,
bizarre species. These are represented by vermin
resource cards.
They can be found in Bug Patches during
showdowns and sometimes found as a result of
events.
Vermin cards have rules that describe how
each vermin can be used. Vermin can also be
cooked using the Cooking Innovation to produce
excellent results!

survivors may spend these resources or activate a

If resources are gained during the Settlement Phase
place them in the play area. '
Groups Gaining Re so urces
When a monster is defeated, the players collect the
rewards fisted on that monster's story event. All living
survivors need to decide how to d1v1de them.
Sharing and spending resources will greatly af-
fect the outcomes of your campaign. Some groups
may divide resources fairly, then trade them. Others
may pool resources together and spend them as a
group.
Resource Limit
When you are directed to gain a resource and that
specific card is not currently in the resource deck , you
do not gain it, nor do you add it to the settlement stor-
age You gain nothing.
This situation can occur when an event or effect of a
card lists a specifc resource to gain , and that resource
is currently being carried by a survivor.

Resources with Special Rules
Some resources have special rules. They can be per-
formed at any time and during any phase by the survi-
vor holding the resource. Some resources have rules
that are triggered when they are gained and should be
performed then.
A resource must be removed from settlement storage
to use its special rules. A survivor may only do this
during the Develop step of the settlement phase.
Trading Resources
Sometimes a survivor will gain a resource with special
rules that may greatly benefit another survivor
During the Hunt Phase, survivors may give each
other resources at the start of any hunt turn before an
event is revealed.
During the Showdown Phase, survivors may give
each other resources anytime during their act 1f they
are adjacent. A survivor can pass a resource as they
are moving by without ending their movement.
Survivors may freely trade resources during the
Settlement Phase.
When a survivor receives a resource from anoth-
er survivor, it is not considered gained.
Resources Stay in the Settlement
Once resources are brought to the settlement, they
may not be taken on future hunts and showdowns
Any resources taken from the settlement's storage
must be returned dunng the Record & Archive Re ·

The Hunt Phase
During the Hunt Phase, players will ·
Choose a quarry
Set up the hunt board
. Hunt the quarry along the hunt board until a show-
down begins or the hunt fails.
Table Setup
Place the hunt board (the opposite side of the settle-
ment board) on the table. Place the gear grids, and
record sheets of the survivors that compose the hunt
team on the table.
Choose Your Quarry
Before departing on a hunt, choose a quarry from the
list of available monsters on the Quarry List of your
settlement record sheet.
Some monsters cannot be hunted, and only ap-
pear as a result of story events or nemesis encoun-
ters on the timeline (i.e., the Butcher, King's Man, or
The Hand).
If this is a nemesis encounter, skip the hunt
phase and move directly to the showdown.
Choose the Monster Level
Decide the level of the monster (usually 1, 2, or 3).
The higher the level, the more difficult the monster
will be to hunt and defeat.
Set Up th e Hun t
The hunt is the survivors' journey to find their quarry.
Survivors travel along the hun t boa rd, facing pe rils
along the way.
• Ru les•
Hunt Board
The hunt board has 13 spaces, including a Start
space, an Overwhelming Darkness space, and a
Starvation space.
Hunt Event Cards
There are two types of
hunt event cards, basic
hunt event cards and
monster hunt event
cards.
Basic hunt event cards
describe events survivors may encounter out in the
darkness.
Monster hunt event cards describe events that
occur while tracking a specific monster.
Hunt Board Setup
Each monster's story event has a diagram of the hunt
b oard showing where to place monster hunt events
and the monster miniature.
1. Shuffle the monster's hunt event cards. Place one
monster hunt event card from the deck facedown
on all the spaces indicated with an "E" on the hunt
board diagram.
2. Place one basic hunt event card in every open
space on the hunt board except those occupied
by a monster hunt event card, the Start space,
Overwhelming Darkness, and Starvation.
3. Place any hunt event cards triggered by gear in
your gear grid (i.e., sickles and pickaxes).
4. Place the monster's miniature on the hunt board,
according to its level, in the space indicated on
the hunt board diagram.
5. Place the departing survivor miniatures on the
Start space of the hunt board.

Hunt Event Cards
Basic hunt event cards are identical and direct the
event revealer to roll on the hunt event table to deter-
mine what happens next.
The hunt event table lists 100 possible events
the survivors may encoun ter. The event revealer
rolls "1d100" to ran domly determine th e event.
To roll 1d 100 , take 2d1 0 and nomin ate one die to
be tens and one to be o nes. Ro ll them together for a
result between 1 and 100.

ones d ie result 1s 5, • the event number 1s 35. Turn
to html eve nt 35 ,n t he hunt event table, read it aloud,
and resolve it
Hunt Events
Often, hunt events will require players to roll on a ta-
ble to determine the outcome of an event. Each event
will specify who should roll ( event revealer, random
survivor, or survivors meeting a certain criteria). It no
survivor is specified, the event revealer roll s.
The event revealer is also responsible for making
any random ized c ho ices (picking random survivor s,
gear, etc). T he ev ent reveal er can use dice , n ames
in a hat, or wh atever th ey prefer.
Some events w ill have requ ireme nts for survivors to
participate. For i nstance , some eve nt s require survi-
vo rs to have high levels of co u rage or understandi ng
to participate in the event.

Reaching Overwhelming Darkness
' The first time in a hunt the s
urv1vors
move into the Overwhelming Dark
ness space, they trigger the Over-
whelming Darkness story event
The survivors cannot skip Over-
whelming Darkness. If they move
through th e space for any reason
instead, stop hunt board move~
ment and resolve Overwhelming
Darkness (before any other events
or effects on this space). Resolve
any other events on this space then
continue to the next space on the hunt board.
If tor some reason, the survivors move into or through
overwhelming Darkness more than once in a single
hunt phase, treat 11 as a blank space.
Gaining Gear on the Hunt
If a survivor gains gear during the hunt phase, they
may add it to their grid immediately. If their gear grid
1
s full, they must either archive the acquired gear (un-
less it ,s cursed) or another piece of gear from the
gear grid to make room for the new gear . A gear grid
may not be rearranged when this occurs, and the
item cannot be added to another survivor 's gear grid.
Event Damage
Survivors may suffer damage during the hunt. This is
event damage and is non-lethal. Event damage will
still reduce armor points and insanity, cause light and
heavy injuries, but will not cause severe injuries or
brain trauma. Any damage accrued on the hunt per-
sists into the showdown phase.
Any tokens gained on the hunt remain through the af -
termath of the following showdown or the beginning
Rules-
of 
th 
e next settlement phase whichever comes first.
Severe Injuries and Brain Trauma
In special cases. survivors may suffer severe in1unes
or brain traumas during the hunt. These cases will be
clearly indicated on an event.
Ap_p ly any attribute modifiers, impairments, and re-
strictions from 1niuries and brain traumas suffered on
the hunt to the showdown that follows 11 (including
bleeding token s). If you must skip the next hunt as a
result of an injury, this refers to the next hunt, not the
remainder of the current one.
Retire on the Hunt
If a survivor retires dunng the hunt, they participate
in the coming showdown and return to the settlement
with any victorious survivors. When they return, they
retire, never to hunt again.
Death on the Hunt
If survivors perish dunng the hunt phase, all of their
gear (except any gear with the irreplaceable rule)
returns to the settlement storage unless the event
states otherwise. It may not be used by the remain-
ing survivors on the hunt.
Ambush
If the monster moves into the survivors' hunt board
space, the survivors are ambushed. End any current
hunt events and start the showdown 1mmed1ately ,
If the survivors are ambushed by the monster, they
must skip their first turn. In most cases. this means
that the monster will take two turns.
Some hunt events allow the survivors to ambush the
monster . When the monster is ambushed, survivors
may choose to go first in the showdown. Do not fol-
low the setup rules for terrain on the monster's story
event Instead, place the listed showdown terrain,
the monster, and survivors on the showdown board
as the players decide (setup rules on terrain cards
must still be followed)
Compulsory Movement
Some hunt events or effects may move the survi-
vors When this happens, move the group the indi-
cated number spaces forwards or backwards. The
survivors cannot move past the Start or Starvation
spaces.
The Hunt Fails
If the survtvors perish on the hunt, reach the end of
the hunt board without a showdown, or the monster
moves off of the hunt board, the Hunt Phase ends
and the quarry is lost.
Apply the rules on the Starvation space ol the hunt
board The lantern year is over, and a new settle-
ment phase begins.
Run Away
If the survivors' settlement has innovat ed Picto-
graphs, they may trigger the Run Away story event
at any time during the hunt. Running lrantically lor
home rarely has good outcomes, but may be an im-
provement on looming death.
In this case, each escaping survivor must trigger the
story event individually. Tum to the Run Away story
event and follow the rules for attempting escape.

Monster controllers can use
give the advantage to the monster or to the group, or
approach each decision randomly.
Some attacks have collateral damage that effect sur-
vivors in a zone In these cases, these survivors are
not targets unless stated otherwise.
Common Targeting Terms
Facing · A monster ,s facing all spaces on the board
that are In front of the miniature
In field of view. A survivor ,s always In a monster's
field of view, unless they are ,n the monster's blind
spot or the monster's line of sight ,s blocked Only
terrain with the Obstacle rule blocks field of view
These rules are descnbed In the Terrain section
In range · A survivor is in range of a monster if the
number of spaces between them is less than or
equal to ,ts current movement (including modifiers)
If in range is followed by a number, such as
range (8), that number replaces the monster's move-
ment when calculating to see rt a survivor is in range.
Zachary is in range, Erza is out of range.

Closest survivor/threat: The survivor/ threat fewest
spaces from the monster.
Last to wound: The last survivor to wound the monster.
Non-deaf survivors: Survivors not suffering from
the deaf severe head injury.
Most/ Least: Zero can count as most or least unless
otherwise stated.
When the monster controller draws and plays Vi-
cious Claw , the first action on the card is Pick Tar-
get. Starting at the top, check each item on the Pick
Target hst to see if any survivors satisfy the target
rule. Stop when the first target is found. If more than
one survivor satisfies a target rule, the monster con-
troller chooses one.

Move & Attack Target Actions
Move & Attack Target actions are the most common
way a monster will attack survivors. Move & Attack
Target, unless specifically stated otherwise, Is an in-
struction to move the monster towards its target up
to ,ts current movement or until adJacent, turn to face
them, and attack using the action's attack profile. If a
monster Is already adjacent to its target, it will turn to
face its target and attack without moving.
Variants of Move & Attack Target
Other actions, such as Materialize & Attack Target,
or Move & Intimidate Target, are performed similarly
to Move & Attack Target, but with the rules of another
behavior substituting for a portion of the action.
The Materialize & Attack Target action on the
Phoenix's Wing Punch A l is performed the same way
as a Move & Attack Target action, but the Phoenix
materializes facing and adjacent to the target instead
of moving. Likewise, the Move & Intimidate Target ac-
tion on Butcher's Gaze of Truth Al card full moves the
Butcher the same way as a Move & Attack Target ac -
tion , but intimidates the survivor instead of attacking.
Some attack profiles will only be preceded by
an instruction to attack target. On these profiles, the
monster does not move b efore attacking.
Some actions will sim ply state to full mo ve to-
wards target, then attack target. T his is effectively the
same as a Move & Attack Target action.
•Rules
Monster Movement
Actions will dictate when to move the monster Most
commonly, this will be In the form of a Move & Attack
Target action after a monster has picked a target
When an action instructs a monster to move to-
ward a target, the monster controller must identify
the shortest path between the monster and the tar-
get, then move the monster miniature along that path
until It Is adjacent to the target or has no movement
remaining. 11 there are multiple paths tied for the short-
est, the monster controller chooses one.
Regardless of their size, monsters move 1 space
at a time in cardinal directions (not diagonal).
After the White Lion plays Vicious Claw and picks a
target, It will proceed to the next action on the card,
Move & Attack Target.
To move towards the target, the monster control-
l er first chooses the shortest path between the mon-
ster and the survivor, then moves 1 cardinal space at
a time al ong that path. Since the White Lion's move -
ment is 6 and t he survivor is 7 spaces away, the mon -
ster contro ll er is able to move the monster to a space
ad jacen t to the target.
The monster has turned to face Zachary.
It 1s now facing all of the indicated spates.
Atter moving the monster, turn to face the survivor, re-
solve any instances of coll1s1on, then attack the target
using the card's attack profile.
Some attacks have reach (the long halberd of the
King's Man) or range In these cases, move the mon-
ster the minimum number of spaces it must move to
attack its target
Full Move
Full move Is a term that describes a monster or sur-
vivor's maximum available movement, taking into
account any posIt1ve or negative movement modllier
tokens.
For example, a Level 1 White Lion (movement 6)
with a -1 movement token would have a lull move of 5 .
Forward, Back, Aw ay, an d Toward
Some actions and rules will specify a direction lor the
monster to move
Forward: This is the direction the monster is currently
lacing.
Back: This is the opposite direction the monster 1s
currently facing .
Away : This is usually in coniunction with something
on the b oa rd (e .g ., all survivors, the attacker, a board

Playing Durat i on Al Ca rds
In order to be resolved and discarded, duration
cards must be drawn twice
The first time a duration card is drawn, perform
any "when drawn face down" actions. Then, instead
of discarding it, place the duration card in play face
up on top of the Al deck .
The next time a monster would draw an Al
card, it will draw the duration card for a second time.
Perform any "when drawn face up" actions. Then,
discard the card
Some duration cards will have effects that are
persistent while they are face up on top of the Al
deck, waiting to be drawn again.
Any effects that manipulate the Al deck besides
wounding (rawhide headband, whistling mace) are
ignored while a duration Is face up.

When a survivor gains a sur-
vivor status card, place it in
a convenient location next to
their gear grid The effects on
the card apply only to them .
Some status cards will
have conditions that will need
to be monitored and tracked
Others grant survivors actions
that are unique to a show-
down.
If a monster's story event has a Survivor Status
card ,n its setup, all survivors gain the card at the
start of the showdown.
Damage Outside of Attack Actions
Some Al cards cause damage without choosing a tar-
get or without exphc1tly attacking
For instance, resolving damage from the White
Lion's Grasp triggers grab Grab deals 1 additional
damage per monster level to the attacked survivor
Damage dealt outside of an attack profile is re-
solved normally, but Is not modified by the monster's
attributes or tokens, If no hit location is specified, roll
the hit location die
Damage dealt outside of an attack profile cannot
be dodged, since It does not result from a hit.
Healing
When a monster performs heal X, they return X
wounds from the Wound Stack to the Al deck . Without
looking at them, take the number ol wounds healed
from the top of the Wound Stack and place them on
the bottom of the Al deck.

Survivors' Turn
The second part of a round 1s the Survivors' turn.
During the survivors' turn, survivors act one at a time,
completing their entire act before another survivor
may act.
Survivors may act in any order, taking advantage
of different gear, abilities, and fighting arts to make the
most of their collective turn
Act Overview

Survivors can spend O to move . Survivors move one
space at a time, to any adJacent unoccupied space ,
moving on ly in cardinal directions (not diagonal)
Survivors cannot move through spaces occupied by
monsters or other survivors (even 11 they are knocked
down) Survivors may move before or after spending
activation
Activation
Survivors can spend O to activate gear, interact with
terrain, or acltvate other special rules (e.g ., fighting
arts, abilities) These special rules will clearly state
what happens when O ,s spent
How Survivors Attack

number of wounds the monster has suffered.
6. Fellow survivors React
survivors that are not the attacker may have an
opportunity to perform survival actions .
7. Perform Reactions
Hit location cards may have reactions . The
three types of reactions are Wound , Failure,
and Reflex.
• Wound : Perform if wound attempt succeeds.
• Failure: Perform if the wound attempt fails.
• Reflex: Always perform (unl ess critical wound) .
8. Resolve the Hit Location
Discard the hit location card face up on the
~onster control panel. If unresolved hit loca-
tions . remain in this attack , select the ne xt hit
lo~at1on t? resolve. Return to step 1 and resolve
this location.
If all hit locations are resolved, end the attack.

Perfect Hits
An attack roll that 1s a lantern 1o is a Perfect Hit
When there are multiple Perfect Hits in a s·

Ing e at-
tack, each triggers its own rules separately.
For example, If Allister attacks with a Scrap Dag-
ger and rolls two perfect hits, his strength 
1
s mcreased
by +4 for the rest of the attack
Monster Evasion
Evasion makes a monster more difficult to hit. For ev-
ery + 1 evasion token the monster has, the accuracy
required tor an attack roll to hit increases by 1.
Conversely, for every - 1 evasion token the accu-
racy required for an attack roll to hit decreases by 1 .
Monster Toughness
Every toughness token a monster has increases the
monster's toughness by 1 .
Conversely, every -1 toughness token a monster
has decreases its toughness by 1.
Traps
When a Trap is drawn from a hit, resolve it immedi-
ately. If a monster is knocked down when a Trap is
drawn , 1t will stand and resolve the Trap.
To resolve a Trap , end all survivors' attacks and
discard all unresolved hit locations, then perform the
actions on the Trap card. Th is does not end the survi-
vor's act, Just the current attack(s).
Once a Trap is resolved, discard it and shuffle all
hit location cards in the deck and discard pile.
First Strike
First Strike hit locations must be selected and resolved
first If multiple First Strike hit locations are drawn , the
attacker chooses the order in which they are resolved.
· flul e,;.
Impervious
Impervious hit locations are impossible to wound ,
even with a lantern 10. However, a survivor must
s~ill attempt to wound this location If an impervious
hit location is cnllcally wounded, perform any listed
effects, but do not wound the monster.
control panel
Persistent Injuries
When a hit location with a persistent in1ury ts on the
monster control panel, It 1s no longer part of the mon -
ster hit location deck. Do not shuffle It back in.
Super - Dense
Super-Dense hit locations can destroy the weapon
that struck th em. If a survivor attacking with a trail
weapon attempts to wound a super-dense hit location,
archive the weapon at the end of the attack.
Critical Wounds
A critical wound occurs when a wound roll result is a
lantern 1 O on a hit location with a critical wound effect.
Critical wounds are lucky blows that always
wound a monster, even if the hit strength does not
exceed the monster's toughness.
Luck increases the range of wound roll results
considered critical wounds. + 1 luck causes a critical
wound on an unmodified wound roll result of 9 or 1O,
+2 luck: 8, 9, or 10, and so on .
A hit location without a critical wound listed can-
not be critically wounded.
Critical Wound Effects
Critically wounding a monster has two important ef-
fects:
1. All reactions( ♦) on the critically wounded hit location
are canceled. This includes wound, failure, and reflex,
including reactions that might be beneficial to survivors.
2. Perform the rules listed in the critical wound section
of the hit location card. If a monster gains attribute
modifier to kens, place them on the monster control
panel. If there is a persistent Iniury listed on the hit lo-
cation, do not di scard the hit location at the end of the
attack. Ins tead , place the card in play on the monster
Persistent ln1uries can have conditional rules that
effect various parts of the showdown. It 1s important to
reference them often and ensure that these rules are
not missed.
For example. Allister has critically wounded the White
LJon 's Beast's Heel hit location. According to the
rules on the card. the White Lion is knocked down.
After any attacks are resolved, instead of discarding
Beast's Heel, the monster controller places it on the
monster control panel since the persistent injury, Rup-
tured Tendon 1s marked as 'Keep in Play ." From now
on. whenever the White Lion starts movement the
monster controller must roll 1d1 O ff the result 1s 1, the
monster is knocked down instead of moving.
Movement During an Attack
Monsters may move during the Survivors' turn, often
as a result of reactions to an attack. When a mon-
ster moves during an attack, all unresolved hits from
the attacking survivors that are now out ol range are
canceled.
Place the Survivor
Although they usually change a survivor's location on
the showdown board, rules specifying to place a sur-
vivor are not considered movement.
Survivor Healing
When survivors heal, they restore previously-tilled
injury levels and lost armor points. Do this by eras-
ing filled injury level boxes or restoring armor as de-
scribed by the specific heal rule.

them to move up to their available movement.

spend 1 survival to surge. A survivor who surges
gains + 1 0 , which must be spent 1mmed1ately. This
allows them to attack by activating a weapon, interact

Aosolve the rosults of the surge (including mon-
ster reactions or outcomes) before resuming the turn.
Survival Opportunities
There are moments during the frantic chaos of combat
that survivors may exploit to their advantage. These
moments are survival opportunities, and are the only
times that survivors may dash or surge.
Survival opportunities exist at the following times:
- Between actions on the survivors ' turn
. During flows on monster Al cards
. At specific points during survivor attacks
- When a monster is knocked down

During Survivor Attack s
An attacking survivor cannot perform survival actions
(including dodge). However, during a fellow survivor's
attack there are two specific opportunities for other
survivors to interrupt and perform survival actions:
1 After the attacker rolls to wound, but before a mon-
ster resolves ,ts reaction. If a hit location does not
have a reaction, there is no opportunity for survivors
to act.
2. When the attacker causes a critical wound, after
any critical wound effects are applied, but before the
card is discarded.
Once th e survival action is fu ll y resolved (including
monster reactions, eff ec t s, and or movement), the in -
terrupted attack resumes.

Survivor Death
A survivor can die during the showdown 1n a variety
of ways. Regardless of how they met their end, re-
move their miniature from the showdown board when
a survivor dies. They can no longer participate in the
fight.
When a survivor dies, their gear is returned to
the settlement storage (except any gear with the ir -
replaceable rule) . If all the survivors die during the
showdown, all of their gear is returned to the settle-
ment.
Monster Death
A monster is defeated when it is wounded and there
are no Al cards in the Al deck or Al discard pile to
move to the wound stack.
If a wound leaves a monster without any cards in its
Al deck or its Al discard pile, it will perform its Basic
Action instead of drawing Al cards untll 11 1s defeated

Gaining Gear During the Showdown
If a survivor gains gear during the showdown phase,
they may add it to their grid immediately. If their gnd is
fu ll , they must either archive the new gear (unless it ,s
cursed) or a pi ece of gear they are curren tl y carrying to
make room. Their grid may not be rearranged and the
item cannot be added to another survivor's gear gnd.
