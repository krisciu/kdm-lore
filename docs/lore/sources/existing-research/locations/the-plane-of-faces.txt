The Scribe
The Scribe is the power behind the Kings and their armies. To men, he is a god made flesh, appearing
in repose atop his throne with his tome hoisted by a grotesque tableau of slaves. In his book his words
are writ into reality, sewing the seeds of small human settlements into existence with the stroke of his
quill. Once the humans grow and reproduce the Scribe will return to harvest his crop.

The King
The rhythmic scape and clang of the King's Men's march heralds the arrival of the King. The King's
ornate carapace is wrapped in shi�ing robes that hide the ravenous creature within. Everyone in the
King's path is consumed without mercy as the King's Men look on from behind their passive, cherub
masks.
