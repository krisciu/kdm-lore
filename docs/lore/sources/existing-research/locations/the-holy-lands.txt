1st Lion Knight
The first Lion Knight was a failure. Its vision permanently fixed a few moments into the future, it was
driven mad living outside of time and deemed too unstable to lead the Golden Entityʼs armies. Now
imprisoned deep within the Golden Labyrinth, the first Lion Knight stews in its derangement, the
heady stench attracting Wailing Smoke from all corners of the abyss. The first Lion Knight spends its
lonely days in lively conversation with them.
2nd Lion Knight
Three brother generals command the vast armies of the Golden Entities domain. Each imbued with a
di�erent temperament and a strong will of their own. The middle brother is the most attached to the
human industry and artistry. He cultivates a courtly civilized appearance and graceful swordsmanship,
surrounding himself with human thralls allowing them to enjoy their short tragic existence in his
awesome presence.
The Lion Knight is the most human of the Golden Entities creations and is forever obsessed with truly
understanding man.
Ash, Ryan, and Sam are scholars raised and educated from the Lion Knight's private museums. They
share a life of luxury and discovery, o�en traveling with the Lion Knight on grand art collecting
expeditions. Their unique life makes them some of the most knowledgeable women in all of Kingdom
Death. Granting them domain over even some White Speaker stories, including the secrets of ageing,
giving them eternally healthy and youthful bodies.

Chosen
The apotheosis of the Entity's bottomless narcissism, the Chosen are created in the Entity's self-
image. Its glory made flesh. Imbued with savage beauty matched by their intense vanity. The grinding
machinery of the Holy Lands freezes wherever they pass. Through their eyes the Entity casts its self-
loving gaze upon the vastness of its creation.
Although they walk the land unchallenged their impetuous rage leave swaths of smoldering ruin in
their wake.

Grand Mother
Few chosen victims survive the treatment of raw god metal that prepares a womb to withstand and
nurture the ghastly cocktail that gives rise to the monsters of the Holy Lands. The truly holy mothers
are beatified as Grand Mothers, transformed into creatures embodying the maternal life-giving ideal of
the Entity. These special few give birth to the Entity's most precious children, the massive winged
Blessed Ones. The Grand Mother's womb is braced heavy ornate gut plates. Within, a hostile furnace of
creation churns. She has a mouthed cord growing from her belly that devours male organs of her
mates to better the chances of divine conception.
The Grand Mother is a rare, horrifying foe, possessing a master the Other and protected by the
watchful eye of the Entity itself.

Wet Nurse
The Wet Nurse is a single minded monster that serves the Entity of the Holy Lands. Its only purpose is
to nourish the creatures born in the Holy Lands with the molten milk it produces. This is the nutrition
that carries within it the imperatives and instincts to serve the Entity of the Holy Lands. The monsters
birthed by the Mothers and Grand Mothers of the Holy Lands are taken by the Wet Nurses who's milk is
the very will of the Entity. Humans taken from their mothers at birth are nursed by the Wet Nurses to
create the mindless shambling masses of Holy Landers that live in the Entity's fiefdom.

White Knight
The glorious White Knights are the military might of the Holy Lands and enforcers of the Golden
Entity's capricious whims. Their exquisitely cra�ed white and gold armor makes no sound as they
march through the dark, narrow passages of the Holy City and beyond. What dwells inside the fully-
enclosed armor is a mystery. Many speculate they are born from the furnace guts of the Mothers,
unfeeling, loyal byproducts of human birth experimentation.
What dwells inside the exquisitely cra�ed armor is a mystery born in the furnace guts of the Mothers. A
byproduct of generations of eugenic experimentation transforming the people of the Holy Lands in
the service of the Golden Entity.
White Knight Heavy
The White Knight Heavy is the backbone of the military ranks, their enormous weapons bringing up
the rear of the Holy Lands' brutal martial forces.

White Lion
Huge terrifying lions with a strange human curiosity and human hands. Their white fur shines with
flecks of gold when the sunlight hits them directly, a strange contrast to their bloated and sad faces.
They are a dominant predator in the holy lands and have become a symbol of inspiration and beauty
for the entity that resides over all. Occasionally they are trained and kept as partners by Man-Hunters.
