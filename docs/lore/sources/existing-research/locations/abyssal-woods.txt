Flower Witch
The Abyssal Woods exists on the precipice of obliteration, its heavy limbs pulled inexorably towards
black hole at its center. The Flower Witch flickers through the woods, tending to inscrutable tasks that
keep it from swallowing itself. Her seemingly random alterations create wonder and death for
foolhardy travelers.

Disciple of the Witch – One
A coven of disciples that assist in the care of the Abyssal Woods; clearing trails, calming boiling rivers,
balancing bacterial colonies, and most importantly, clearing the clots from the infinity web that
encloses the vacuum at the heart of the forest.
The staves of the disciples are topped with a dense mineral, so saturated with colors that it appears
black to human eyes. The mineral is the heart of a plant that lives in warm nests deep within a great
inverted mountain. The Flower Witch teaches its disciples to use their staves to manipulate plant life
cycles, commanding them to grow or wither.

Disciple of the Witch - Two
The uniforms of the disciples, their dresses and hats, are spun on the same loom that weaves the
goblin's garments. The fabric is a woven parasite, its fibers absorbing the wearer's blood. These
vestments enable the disciples to grip the ground with incredible strength allowing them to move
freely through the Abyssal Woods even when everything around them is a swirling vortex.
Disciple of the Witch - Three
A hole the size of a grain of sand breathes at the center of the Abyssal Woods. Every inhale threatens to
devour the forest, an intense vacuum rips roots from the ground and sucks waves of tumbling debris
through the air.
Above all else, the Flower Witch teaches the disciples about ego and the beauty of life and death.
Cultivating immaculate beauty at the precipice of destruction strengthens the ego needed to wield the

Disciple of the Witch – Four
Everything that lives in the Abyssal Woods evolves to survive the tantrums of a tiny, unpredictable
orifice at its center. Insects with opposable thumbs cling tenaciously to trees, whose roots have
become powerful, gnarled hands firmly gripping the ground. Seasoned visitors carry chains and hooks
to secure themselves at a moment's notice to the largest things in sight when the winds pick up.
Beyond enabling the disciples to survive the hole of the forest, continued wear of their garments
deepens a symbiotic relationship, granting them even greater understanding and power. However, an
intense caloric intake is required to keep the fabric fed. This can pose a great challenge for young
disciples, who o�en starve to death or are simply consumed by their hat
Disciple of the Witch – Six
The Sleeping Flower has 13 petals, which is as many disciples as the Flower Witch will ever keep.
However, the fi�h petal never uncurls, even when the flower is in full bloom. Its contents are a mystery
to all but the Flower Witch, who privately muses that it will be the burden of the disciple that succeeds
her, inheriting both her mask and her many mistakes.
