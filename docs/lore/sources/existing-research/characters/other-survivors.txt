Survivor (Female) Aya
Hunted as prey, herded and domesticated as dra� animals, humans occupy a low rung on the food
chain of Kingdom Deaths many strange ecosystems. O�en living unawares of their purpose,
occasionally, nightmarish trauma will snap an ignorant human from their delusion of safety. These
survivors are o�en shaped by the particular events that tears the veil from their eyes; some driven by
vengeance, grief, curiosity, or insanity, they share a desperate desire to persist despite the horror of
their newly discovered reality. Survivors are marked by the artifacts they create from the ordeal that
put them on their new path.

The Preacher
Standing over his fallen companions hoarsely crying devotions over the screams of battle. As terror
extinguishes hope, the questionable dogmas begin to make sense, inspiring the wretched to feats of
reckless strength and steadfastness.
Visionary (Female)
Most live a drab life, nurturing a fantasy of their world painted in bold striking colors. Visionaries are
the few that come across a relic that empowers them and demands action. O�en, they will lead many
to their death, building a staircase of corpses towards their lo�y ideals.

Ringtail Fox Survivors
A new expansion under development, that explores people living in underground tunnels below a
dangerous swamp ruled by a great fox-like entity. Securing and expanding the underwater tunnels so
you can increase your population capacity is one of the ideas going into this one.
