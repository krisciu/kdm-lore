conscious and check their Skip Next H~nt box
on the survivor record sheet. Unconscious sur -
vivors return to the settlement at the end of the

ways act s as th e M ons t er controller. They may
freely reorder the mo ns t er Al deck during the
showdown .
The storyteller pi cks wh ich settlement event 
I
s
triggered in the Settl ement Phase.
Solo Play
For the most part , play i ng Monster as a solo cam -
paign will proceed as it doe s for a group of players.
There is one outright chang e In rules, a nd several
suggestions that are strongly advised.
Mod ifications to Rules: Du ring the Showdown
Phase , do not use the monst er co ntroll er tile. No sur-
vivors will gain insanity due to monster ta rg eting.
Organization is the key to g etting through a solo
campaign without losing tra ck of all the possibi l-
ities From beginning to end, your ability to manage
the resources of the settlement allows great latitude
in choices and planning . Instead of competing with
other players for cool gear, you can be more strate·
gIc, thinking of survivors as resources in yo ur in divid·
ual campaign .
When it comes to individual survi vors, be consis·
tent. For eac h survivor , you'll need a char acter re ·
cord shee t, g ear grid, and miniature, mea ni ng you 'll

have to manage 4 sets of ea ch. Make s ure you have
a way to kno w wh ich s heets , grids , and mini atur es
belong to w hich survivor .
one good way of keeping survivors organized is
to decide on a naming convention ahead of time .
Naming the se ttlement in honor to your favorite book ,
TV senes, or movie will m ake it easy to come up with
new nam es as n ee ded, a nd m ay help you keep track
of aspect s like fa mily relat io ns or wea p on prof1cien-
c1es
Make a plan for tactics , but try not to get over-
whelmed by the possibilities. W ith o nl y one player,
you'll need to start thinkin g o f s howd ow n t ac ti cs wh ile
picking which s urvivors will depart for t he H un t P hase
and what g ea r they'll bring . On ce la ntern y ea rs p ass
and the number of opt ion s grow, it w ill be e as y to be
overwhelmed, but if you keep in mi nd what' s w orked
for you in the past, it'll go more s moothly .
Focus on advancing the Settlement, not the Sur-
vivors. At the e nd of the day , as a solo player, your
greatest concern is with dev e loping your community
to improve your survivors, not developi ng the be st
collection of four s urvivors that you c an .
As th e settlement progre s ses , you 'll be able to slowly
bu i ld up a stable of useful s urvivors for the later parts
of the campaign.
Custom Campaigns
If you 're 1tch 1ng for more after c omplet i ng the main

easily custom izable for a group that is fa miliar w ith
