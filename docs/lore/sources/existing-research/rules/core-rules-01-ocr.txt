Introduction and How to Play
Monster is a game about surviving in the darkness.
You lose if your settlement's population reaches zero.
You win when your settlement defeats the Watcher.
Monstens played by 1·4 players• . Together, players will
hunt and fight monsters, using what they scavenge to grow
a small settlement . Each player typically plays as one
survivor and the players take turns controlling the monsters.
This game is cooperative. Players are encouraged to make
long term and split-second decisions as a group, pooling
their efforts to protect their future .
Monster 1s designed to be played as a campaign. Groups of
players will return to the same settlement, and even the
same survivors, over the course of several play sessions.
Simply pick up where you left off the last time you played.
You can play with the same group of people each time or
swap in new friends .
Monster is a miniatures hobby game. An important
component of this game is assembling, customizing and
painting your miniatures. '
To b_egin playing, you only need to assemble the four
starting survivors and the first monster, a White Lion .

when you complete a game session
This game includes more monsters and many options for
customizing your survivors. You can build new versions of survivors
to represent them as they obtain new gear or build entirely new
survivors as some are lost and new ones start out on the hunt.
This game includes dice, 10-sided dice (known as d1 Os) and hit
location dice (a 6-sided die representing parts of the body) .

At its core , Monster is a game about the fragility of human life, the
ferocity of the human spirit , and the wonder of exploration.
Your story will be shaped by the decisions you make , the strengths and
weaknesses of your settlement , and the growth of your survivors. The
game begins with a story that will introduce you to the basic concepts of
the game .

Around him, he saw other people stirring, and beyond, a horizon of unbroken darkness.

The First Story
The First Story Is II prologue to Monster. It will
teach you the fundamentals of the game. Always
start the game with the First Story.
This story picks up after lhe awakening of the
survivors Before they can lake stock of their
surroundings, the survivors must l1ghl for their lives
against o vicious White Lion .
The game 1s designed around 4 survivors To begin
playing, 1f you have fewer than 4 players, some or
all players should create more lhan one survivor so
4 survivors are represenled
You wlll need to assemble the 4 starting survivor
miniatures and the White Lion miniature.
Although this is a prologue, Kingdom Death is a
dangerous place. Even the starting survivors can
pensh before their story truly begins.
What is in the prologue?
The First Story 1s designed to guide the 4 survivors
through their first encounter with a monster. If they
prevail, they will create a brand new settlement. Play-
ers are meant to play as they read and learn the
game .
By the end of this prologue, you should understand
the core rules of game play, complete your first show-
down, create your settlement, and be ready for cam -
paign play.
During the prologue, questions may arise that are not
completely addressed in this section. The aim of the
prologue is to get you playing, so feel free to make
decisions and mistakes. Full game rules that follow
the prologue address the deeper nuances of game-
play once you've got the hang of the basics.

The loft s1do of tho gear grid has a reference area de
scribing the survivors' turn, spending survival, and
fighting baro •handed with Fist & Tooth.
Survivor Record Sheets
Use a survivor record sheet tor each survivor The
record sheet maintains vital information about a sur-
vivors life.
Pencils and erasers are recommended for recor_d
sheets, as you will change them often . Fortune 1s
fleeting, after all.
Only the survivor characteristics vital for a starting
suflllvor 's first showdown are discussed below. Com -
plete rules can be found in the Survivors section of
this rulebook .
Name Your Surv ivor
Name your survivor in the space provided Your sur-
vivor gains 1 survival for having a name Add "1 to
the record sheet in the box labeled Survival.
Learn about Survival
Survival re presents the desperate desire to cling to life.
In the First Story, survival can only be spent to dodge.
As you play, you will gam up to three more life-saving
survival actions: da sh , encourage, and surge .
When survival is spent, decrease the number in the-
Survival box by 1 . Survival does not automatic ally re-
plenish and must be earned through gamepl ay .
Learn About Attributes
Survivors' attributes describe their advantages or
disadvantages. Except for movement, attributes start
at ze ro. W hi le most won't be used during the First
Sto ry , all attrib utes are listed below.
Movement (5): the number of spaces a survivor can
move each turn.
Speed (0): attack rate.
Accuracy (0): attack precision.
Strength (0): attack power.

Attributes
Surv,vors and monsters may gain permanent in -
creases or decreases to their attributes.
update the appropriate box on the survivor record
sheet to reflect changes. All survivor attributes
have a box with a space to pencil 1n the values of
these attributes.
If a survivor gains temporary modifiers to their at-
tributes, place tokens on the record sheet instead
of changing the sheet. Remove these tokens at
the end of the showdown.
If a monster's attributes change, place attribute
modifier tokens on the monster control panel.
Be sure to consider attribute changes when
monsters and survivors attack.
Evasion (0): the ability to avoid attacks.
Luck (0): the likelihood of lucky attacks.
Survival (1 for your name): self-preservation
Insanity (0): mental guard against terror.
Courage (0): bravery.
Understanding (0): wisdom.
Hunt Experience (0): accrued experience.
Weapon Proficiency (0): experience with a weapon.
How Movement Works
A starting survivor's movement is 5, meaning they
may move up to 5 ad1acent unoccupied spaces each
turn, counted cardinally not diagonally.
Survivor Hit Locations
Survivors have 5 hit locations vulnerable to damage
and capable of wearing protective armor:
Head, Arms . Body, Waist, and Legs.
Hit locations have light and heavy injury levels (light
and heavy-lined boxes).
Armor Points
The Cloth starting gear card provides 1 armor porn!
at the waist location (indicated by a 1 In the shield ac-
companied by the waist symbol at the top left of the
card) Record "1" 1n the shield-shaped space next to
Waist on your survivor record sheet to represent the
armor points gained from the Cloth.
Brain and Insanity
The Brain location 1s a survivor's mental fitness. The
fragile Brain has only one injury level. Instead of
armor, survivors use insanity to shield their brains.
Only brain damage harms the Brain location. Ac-
tions that cause brain damage are clearly marked.
When suffering brain damage, insanity protects the
Brain the same way armor protects hit locations.
Insanity keeps survivors steadfast in the face of a
roaring, toothy maw that would bring a sane person to
their knees. Insanity is persistent, and is gained
and lost through gameplay.

Check Your Weapons
A starting survivor has two available weapons - the
Founding Stone and Fist & Tooth. The rules for the
Founding Stone can be found on the Founding
Stone gear card and the rules for Fist & Tooth can
be found on the left side of the gear gnd, along with
useful reference information for survivors.
Each weapon has attack attributes that determine
the outcome of a survivor's attack. Details about
making attacks follow later in this section.
The survivors' Founding Stones have a special abil-
ity (on the bottom of the gear card) . Instead of attack-
ing the monster with the Founding Stone in hand,
survivors may throw it at a monster from anywhere
on the showdown board, causing an automatic criti-
cal wound. Afterwards, the Founding Stone is lost
forever and archived (returned to the game box).

Determine Monster's Target
Consult the Pick Target list on th e Al card This action
tells the monster controller which survivor to target .
Starting at the top, check each ,tern to see ii any
survivors satisfy the target rule. STOP when the first
target 1s found. If more than one survivor can be tar -
geted, It's up to the monster controller to choose .
Common target list terms include
Closest threat: Closest standing survivor. A knocked
down survivor 1s not a threat
Facing: All spaces in front of the monster miniature.
In range: If the monster's movement can end
adjacent to a survivor, they are in range (6 spaces in
any direction for the White Lion).
In field of view: Not in the blind spot (above diagram).

In the case of Claw, the first item in the Pick Target list
is closest threat, facing, ,n range . If the monster can
move 6 or fewer spaces to reach a threat , in the direc-
tion the White Lion is lacing, one of those survivors is
the target (see above diagram) .
If not, check the next item : closest threat, in field of
view . The monster controller should ltnd any threat
not in the White Lion's blind spot. Note , even if the
closest survivor Is out of the White Lion's move-
ment, they still become the target.
If no other targeting directives can be met, the final
item on th e list is no target: sniff. The White Lion will
fall back on an instinct behavior, sniff , if a target is not
found. The rules for sniff are desc ribed above. II the
White Lion sniffs, its turn will end .
Once a target is selected, move to the next section
of the Al card.

number of hits but before rolling hit location dice.
After Damage: Resolve damage from all hits in this
attack then apply additional effects.
Triggered effects appear directly under the attack
profile. In the above example, After Damage from
the attack is applied, trigger knockback 6.
Brain Traumas
Intimidate Actions
Rather than physically harming
survivors, intimidate actions
cripple the mind by causing
brain damage (damage to the
Brain location) . Each Al card
explains how to perform a
specific int1m1dation.
The White Lion does not
need to be adjacent to its
target to intimidate.
Insanity is armor for your Brain . If the survivor's
Brain has no remaining insanity and the Brain injury
level is filled, further damage to the Brain causes a
roll on the Brain Trauma table in this book. Like
damage to other hit locations, rolling on the Brain
Trauma table expends any remaining brain damage.
Survivors may gain disorders as a result of brain
trauma. These are found in the Disorder Deck. Draw
one at random and apply the rules to the survivor.
Severe Injuries & Death
When a survivor's hit location has no remaining armor
points and all in1ury levels are tilled, they are In danger
Any further damage to this hit location will cause a
severe Injury (roll tor that hit location on the Severe
ln1ury story event table In this book)
Remember. survivors may spend survival to dodge 1
hit in these dire circumstances.
Roll once on the table each time the hit location ls
damaged even If the amount of damage Is over 1.
Record effects of severe in1unes in the Impairments
section of the survivor record sheet.
Most often. survivors gain bleeding tokens when they
suffer severe m1uries. When a survivor has 5 bleeding
tokens, they die. Survivors can also die trom results on
the Severe lnJury table. When they die , remove the
survivor's miniature trom the board.

Moods are Al cards that remain in play after the

Enraged gives the White Lion a + 1 damage

Stone's speed is 2. Roll 2d10 to attack.
Count the Number of Hits
Accuracy is the number each attack roll must meet or
exceed to hit. The Founding Stone's accuracy is 7.
Every attack ro ll result of 7 or greater is a hit. If there
were no hits, the attack er misses and their attack ends.
Survivo rs attacking from a monster's blind spot are
at an advantage, and gain +1 to the results of their
attack rolls. In the blind spot, an atta ck ro ll of 6 with a

Attempt to Wound a Location
Strength determines if a hit can penetrate the
monster's toughness to wound it. Make a wound roll
by rolling 1d10. Then add the strength of your
weapon to the result. If this total is equal to or greater
than the White Lion's toughness (6), the monster is
wounded. The Founding Stone's strength is 1, a
wound roll of 5 or greater will wound .
Wound the Monster
When a hit location is wounded, remove the top card
of the At deck without looking at it. Place it in the
wound stack space on the monster control panel.
If the Al deck is empty but there are At cards in the
discard pile, shuffle the discard to create a fresh Al
deck and remove the top card.
Cards in the wound stack are not part of the Al
deck, and represent the number of wounds the mon-
ster has suffered . When the monster Is wounded
and no Al cards can be moved to the wound
stack, the monster is dead.

Al Discard
Wound Stack
Resolve any reactions on the wounded hit loca-
tion that apply (Wound, Reflex. or Failure). Check
for critical wounds, then discard the hit location card
face up in the hit location discard pile on the monster
control panel.
~Critical Wounds
If a hit locatlon has a critical wound effect and the
attacker's wound roll result Is a lantern 10 (the
lantern face Is showing), a critical wound occurs.
Remove the top Al card from the Al deck and place
it onto the wound stack as normal. Perform any criti-
cal wound effects and cancel any reactions listed
on that hit location.
Some critical wound effects award survivors extra
spoils. Resources gained during a showdown should
be placed face up next to the gear grid of the survivor
who earned them. If that survivor perishes, another
survivor may take these resources. If all survivors
perish, these resources are lost.
Example If the survivor critically wounds the
Strange Hand location, they may spend 1 survival (if
they have any) to gain + 1 permanent strength. Add
·1 • to the survivor record sheet in the space for the
Strength attribute and add this strength attribute to
future wound rolls along with weapon strength.
In addition, Strange Hand has a persistent iniury,
Lost Hand that affects some Al cards. When Stange
Hand Is critically wounded , the card stays in play on
the showdown board. Some Al cards will have per-
sistent m1ury actions also called Lost Hand , this per-
sistent m1ury action replaces the attack on the Al card
if the persistent injury occured.
Fighting with Fist & Tooth

Dodge - Survival Actions
In the First Story, survival can be spent to perform a
dodge action The Survival Limit is 1, which is the
maximum amount or survival a survivor may have at
any lime . Any add1t1onal survival gained beyond the
Survival Limit is lost.
Dodge : Once per round, spend 1 survival to cancel
a monster hit from an attack profile. Afte r hi t
locations are rolled but before any severe injury
rolfs , the survivor can dodge a hit of their ch oice.

The hit becomes a miss and does not cau~e
damage. Brain damage, and damage outside of
attack profiles (like Grab) cannot be dodged.
Knockback X
When a survivor suffers knockback X, they are
pushed X spaces in a straight line away fron:, the mon-
ster. II the survivor passes over or ends up ma space
with another survivor, they are both knocked down.
Survivors may not share spaces, move the knocked
back survivor to an adjacent free space. If the survivor
encounters a boa rd edge, stop and end knockback.
Movement Collision
Survivors may not voluntarily pass through spaces
occupied by monsters or other survivors. However,
monsters may pass through survivor-occupied
spaces. If they do, that survivor suffers collision and
is knocked down. If a monster ends its movement in
a survivor-occupied space, the survivor is knocked
down and suffers knockback 5.

Finish the Showdown
It is time to finish the battle between the survivors
and the White Lion.
Each round, continue to pass the monster controller
tile to the next player, draw a fresh Al card, and see
what happens.
If the White Lion has no Al cards in its deck, but
there are cards in the discard pile, shuffle the
discard to create a fresh Al deck.
It no Al cards remain in the Al deck or discard, the
monster will desperately cling to life by performing its
Basic Action (on the Basic Action I monster refer-
ence double-sided card) instead of drawing an Al
card. The next wound it suffers will kill the monster.
How Do We Kill It?
The White Lion is killed when it Is wounded and there
are no Al cards in the Al deck or discard pile to move
to the wound stack. If a monster has no Al cards In
Its deck or discard plle, survivors must still inflict
one more wound to kill the monster.
Survivors Perish
If the survivors die, try again until you emerge
victorious I
Survivors Prevail and Aftermath
If the White Lion is killed, the remaining survivors
are victorious.
In the aftermath, players should flll the first unfilled
box in the Hunt XP section of the survivor record
sheet to reflect their first successful showdown.
