│  • Survivors are "thrown" into existence                    │
│  • No inherent meaning - meaning must be created            │
│  • Freedom is terrifying (choices matter)                   │
│  • Death is ever-present and unavoidable                    │
│  • Authenticity through struggle                            │
│                                                             │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### The Absurd

Influenced by Camus:
- The world is hostile and indifferent
- Survival itself becomes the meaning
- Hope persists despite hopelessness

### Nietzschean Themes

Elements of Nietzsche appear:
- Will to power (survivors growing stronger)
- Übermensch (Saviors transcending humanity)
- Eternal recurrence (campaign cycles)

## Philosophical Questions Raised

| Question | KDM Exploration |
|----------|-----------------|
| What makes us human? | Humanity born from darkness |
| Is there meaning in suffering? | Trauma shapes identity |
| Can we control our fate? | Dice and cards vs. player choice |
| Is civilization worth preserving? | Settlement building as purpose |
| What happens after death? | Ambiguous afterlife hints |

## Thematic Connections

### Hope vs. Despair
- **Lanterns** = Hope (light in darkness)
- **Darkness** = Despair (the default state)
- **Settlement** = Collective hope

### Individual vs. Collective
- Survivors matter individually (names, traits)
- Settlement survival supersedes individuals
- Sacrifice is often necessary

### Creation vs. Destruction
- Crafting from monster parts
- Building civilization
- Inevitable entropy
