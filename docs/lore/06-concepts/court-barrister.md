# Court Barrister

Limit 1 per customer
The Court Barrister is the result of a collaboration between Adam & Lokman, exploring some well established tropes in fantasy art. Originally intended as a small line of Generic Hero Classes, the results were so compelling and un-generic, each hero's appearance told so many exciting stories that we wanted to integrate them into the KD world but so far nothing concrete has emerged.
Investigators must present cases of magical abuses at court. In a many-sided mirror chamber, the barrister is transported to the court where wild magics twist, transform, and echo in the court gallery, awaiting the arrival of the judge.
To stay in the realms of magical adjudication is a constant danger to a mere mortal and their courtly dress is a camouflage of anarchic color and composition to blend in with the mercurial entities that spectate in the court's gallery. With a practiced flourish of ritual, the barrister indicates their readiness to begin. In the shifting confusion of the mirror court, a slim line of perfectly reflective scales briefly shimmers, indicating that the judge has arrived. All rise.
