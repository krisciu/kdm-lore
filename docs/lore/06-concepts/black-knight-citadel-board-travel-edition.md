# Black Knight Citadel Board - Travel Edition

Limit 1 per customer
Mini-scale scale. A preposterously small rendering of the Black Knight's crumbling citadel. A delightful bird's eye view of the airborne, thrashing action. Bounce among the tiny elastomer statues and ring the baby bell altars.
People may ask why it's so expensive. This one is a labor of love and a ton of resin. Despite the miniscule size, this mini-scale project was immense in both photoresin quantities and the dedicated effort of our team to print, clean, and process every absurdly itty bitty bit.+25 Units added.+25 Units added.
