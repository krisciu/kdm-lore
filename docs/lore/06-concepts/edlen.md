# Edlen

Triumphantly hoisting her kill over the settlement's threshold, she compulsively approached the gleaming stone, her reflection drawing near. To her horror, her flawless physique was marred with jagged wounds. Pounding the stone face ground in furstration, she raised a cloud of sparkling dust. It clung to her sticky scabs, deocrating her disfigurements with a lustrous sheen. She watched her reflection, traced with gleaming victory and nodded with satisfaction.
