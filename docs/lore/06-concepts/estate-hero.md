# Estate Hero

Encore Edition: Limit 2 per customer
Teeming subterranean caves, dizzying cloud labyrinths, doom, and conquest await inside the dungeon. But, outside the dungeon, mind the property line. Landlords lucky enough to discover a dungeon entrance on their property employ Estate Heroes to tend the grounds, keeping the thoroughfare clear of pests, wandering menaces, and shaking down newly flush heroes for land use taxes.
Accompanied by a long-eared harehound that listens for the jangling pockets of successful adventures, she uses her minor magical abilities for encouraging the growth of elaborate inviting grounds to keep heroes coming through the door.
Art : Lokman LamSculpture : Team Death
