# Disciple of the Witch - Two

Limit 1 per customer.
The uniforms of the disciples, their dresses and hats, are spun on the same loom that weaves the goblin's garments. The fabric is a woven parasite, its fibers absorbing the wearer's blood. These vestments enable the disciples to grip the ground with incredible strength allowing them to move freely through the Abyssal Woods even when everything around them is a swirling vortex.
Art: Lokman LamSculpture: Jonah Gilbert
