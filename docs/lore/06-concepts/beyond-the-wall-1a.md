# Beyond the Wall

This diorama continues the story of Aya the Survivor. Although released first, this sculpt finds Aya battered and on the run, hiding behind convenient rubble from an unseen foe. We have reissued Beyond the Wall to accompany the release of Before the Wall, a new figure chronicling earlier (more hopeful) moments of Aya's journey.
Kingdom Death: Monster Expansion Content Beyond the Wall reissue includes two new gear cards from the armor set worn by Aya.
Art: Lokman LamSculpture: Hector Moran
Presented in a litho-wrapped matte white box, Beyond the Wall includes:
Hard plastic Beyond the Wall
Scenic base and wall fragment
Matte Art Print
Hard Breastplate and Cloth Leggings gear cards for use in Monster
