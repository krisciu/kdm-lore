# Forsaker

An archival treasure, this miniature is hand-poured one-of-a-kind resin model, a hobbyists delight. This miniature will include imperfections, mold lines, bubbles and minor mold slips typical of the resin casting process. Due to its limited, unique nature, replacements are not available. All sales on this item are final.
The Forsakers lose or give up their grasp on sanity in trade for unbridled power and stamina. They see nothing but suffering and pitiful struggle around them, incapable of compassion, they channel their despair into unchecked furious berserk state that makes the Forsaker dangerous to friend and foe alike.
Art: Yasmine PutriSculpture: Thomas David

1 x Resin Forsaker
