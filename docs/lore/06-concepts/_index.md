## Core Concepts

### The Entity / The Other

The Entity (sometimes called "The Other") is a cosmic force that may be responsible for:
- The creation of the world
- The existence of monsters
- The "gifts" given to certain survivors

### Time in Kingdom Death

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Lantern Year** | A cycle of settlement life, not necessarily a calendar year |
| **Timeline** | The progression of events that define a campaign |
| **Cycles** | Patterns that repeat across campaigns and realities |

### The Spiral Path

The Spiral Path represents the journey from ignorance to understanding—though in Kingdom Death, understanding often brings madness.

## Philosophical Implications

These concepts raise questions about:
- **Free will** - Are survivors' choices predetermined?
- **Reality** - Is the world a dream or creation?
- **Purpose** - Why do survivors exist?
- **Transcendence** - Can humanity escape its fate?
