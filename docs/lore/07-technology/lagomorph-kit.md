# Lagomorph Kit

Limit 1 per customer
The fluctuating anatomy of the bunny kits will only stabilize with an aggressive diet of quivering grey matter. With each successive molting, their shape starts to resemble the nightmares, expectations, and memories they consume. Gingerly they crawl along the tendrils strung through the canopy of darkness, searching for choice morsels in the half eaten meals of mature lagomorphs without becoming meals themselves.
Art: Kyuyong EomSculpture: Team Death
